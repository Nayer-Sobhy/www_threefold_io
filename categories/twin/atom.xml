		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/artheon-blog-one/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year at a ThreeFold gathering, a few of us on the team had the pleasure to meet a man named Vasily, a creative mind with a big heart and proud founder of Artheon.¬†Artheon, in its essence, was a virtual reality museum experience focused on bringing fine art and culture from around the world directly to people. The concept was immediately captivating, and the demo brought it to life for us. The graphics were already solid, and being able to walk around a museum and interact with the artwork was a unique experience to say the least. We¬†talked about the implications and his greater vision around access and education, and it was very clear we needed to partner up. Not long after, Artheon and ThreeFold joined forces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-partnership-all-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-the-partnership-all-about&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-the-partnership-all-about&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is the partnership all about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with ThreeFold, Artheon aims to create the world‚Äôs largest open art database ‚Äì made for everyone, and owned by everyone. We will provide access to art and cultural heritage to people around the world, without borders. Not just access, but a high-quality and high-resolution virtual reality experience where people can really immerse themselves in their surrounding environment. With Artheon, people can now even touch and hold paintings or artifacts, something that would clearly not be possible in real life. And while today, only a select few (relative to the total global population) have the opportunity to travel and to experience museums and cultural &amp;amp; sacred sites, Artheon will change that!
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
It‚Äôs not only about experience, though, it‚Äôs also about community and education and providing a more equal access to art and cultural objects.¬†We‚Äôll bring together a global community of museums, artists, and art seekers who can not only enjoy, but also teach and learn about the art and cultural objects housed within the Artheon universe. For Artheon, it‚Äôs imperative
that people are able to access information about the artists and the art itself, and then make and share their own perceptions as well. No need or pressure to follow the direction of the current system‚Äôs ideology. This is a different angle from how we traditionally learn at school, where narrow or accepted views and concepts are imposed upon us. A key aim of Artheon is to bring different perspectives through collective, participatory, and experiental¬†teaching and learning.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Looking ahead, the vision is that people will be able to create their own virtual spaces and expose them on Artheon. They can create something from scratch or even re-imagine a historical site as it was long ago and share it with the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-threefold-benefit-artheon&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-threefold-benefit-artheon&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-threefold-benefit-artheon&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does ThreeFold benefit Artheon?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start, there was a clear connection between Artheon and ThreeFold from a vision, values, and ethos perspective. But there are also some more specific reasons why Artheon chose and benefits from ThreeFold, which mainly revolve around the decentralized nature of the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR)¬†provide significant benefits to our new digital reality. These technologies open new ways of sharing information¬†in areas such as¬†the arts in the case of Artheon,¬†allowing for upgraded¬†and immersive experiences for users.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Decentralized clouds have been associated with the promise of new digital applications and services that come with a hyper-connected life.¬†Because the graphics of VR&#x2F;AR experiences require heavy rendering, on-device processes are augmented by splitting workloads between the VR&#x2F;AR device and a decentralized cloud. So, graphics rendering on a decentralized cloud like what the ThreeFold Grid provides would be significantly improved by achieving a much¬†lower latency.¬†Another advantage of the ThreeFold Grid is that it provides an extremely high level of security and privacy, empowering Artheon and its users with real data sovereignty.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And finally, Artheon experienced an unfortunate event earlier this summer where their servers suffered from an intense heat wave and essentially burned up. There was no backup, and this would have been catastrophic in the scenario of them having millions of users. Good thing¬†they aren‚Äôt live yet, but this is a great example of how centralized models fail. With a decentralized infrastructure like ThreeFold, this type of situation would not have occured, as data would be hosted on many locations.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So, by distributing the computing power closer to their users, a VR experience such as Artheon would not only improve their latency speed, security, and privacy, but also the resilience of their business model.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-status-of-artheon-and-its-partnership-with-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-the-status-of-artheon-and-its-partnership-with-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-the-status-of-artheon-and-its-partnership-with-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is the status of Artheon (and its partnership with ThreeFold)?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Artheon has been making incredible improvements to the graphics and experience, and adding as many new pieces of art as possible into the universe. As you can imagine, the possibilities really are endless, but here are some of the milestones planned for the rest of this year:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning to add partial DLC (downloadable content) support and photogrammetry-scanned locations for users to experience&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New UI for desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation of desired social features such as follower and friend system&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will be able to see who of their friends or people they follow are online¬†‚Äì from that, they can connect to a server and join them to share experiences together&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will also be able to see how many people are online at the moment and where they are located on the globe (if permissions are allowed)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the possibility for museums to host free or closed paid exhibitions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artheon will be hosted on the ThreeFold Grid!
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-now-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-can-you-do-now-to-get-involved&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-can-you-do-now-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What can you do now to get involved?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre reading this section, we‚Äôre thrilled you are interested in what is happening with Artheon! We are, too! As Artheon is not yet live,¬†the best option for you is to join &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;artheon&quot;&gt;the Artheon Early Access chat on Telegram&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; where you can stay tuned there for updates and ask questions directly to Artheon‚Äôs creators and contributors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>This ThreeFold Farm Keeps Veggies Warm</title>
		<published>2021-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/blockheating-intro/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/blockheating-intro/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the Netherlands, a ThreeFold Farm is supporting the growth of vegetable crops such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. By directing the excess heat generated from the hardware operations to the greenhouse next door, they are able to achieve an incredible model that benefits both hardware and vegetables. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Jeroen Burks, CEO of Blockheating, tells us everything we need to know about their sustainable farming operations. As far as he can remember, Jeroen has always been a protagonist of the ‚Äúno waste‚Äù approach. He started by recycling material previously used by the tech industry, mainly in the cloud market. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúBy default, most data center operations replace their power supplies every 3 years, no matter the state they are in. They are being replaced to counter any possible downtime.‚Äù 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By refurbishing and repurposing ‚Äúold‚Äù power units from data centers, he gives them a second life as electric tractor chargers, lithium ION pack chargers, and more. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúYou just need to trick the unit into thinking it is still powering servers, add some cables here and there, and it is ready for duty.‚Äù 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
His quest towards sustainability started when he was challenged on a pilot project. His friend had bought a new building and was looking for the most sustainable approach to heating it. Jeroen came up with the idea of putting two server racks in the basement and using the heat from that operation, to heat the offices and spaces above. While this project was a success, Jeroen realised that it could be way more efficient, if done with other structures. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
He quickly engaged with a second pilot project where he used two server racks to heat a small greenhouse. This model turned out to be a great combination, which benefited both hardware, as well as farming operations. And so sprouted ‚ÄòBlockheating‚Äô ‚Äì a data center that provides heat for tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. Why specifically these vegetables? Well, the Netherlands has a fair amount of greenhouses cultivating them, and these ‚Äòveggies‚Äô need that heat during summer nights. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Right now Blockheating has around 400 compute nodes with direct cooling that stores all the heat in a buffer throughout the day, which is then released into the greenhouses during the night hours.
‚ÄúBy doing it the way we do, we grow the internet grid, help grow vegetables and curb fossil fuel usage ‚Äì in carbon negative compute power!‚Äù 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Right now, Blockheating has a portion of their data center dedicated to ThreeFold Farming for a few reasons:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alignment of values is huge&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold Farming is easy to manage&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold Farming counters wasteful behavior of internet resources, so it‚Äôs a triple win&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Blockheating envisions to scale up-to three data centers of this kind, in an interconnected way, with a fiber ring between them. By doing so, they will be able to increase their offering and have a larger impact on countering the wasteful patterns of the cloud industry. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold is proud to have Blockheating as a ‚ÄòState-of-the-Art‚Äô Farmer and Partner, and hopes to see many more people and companies inspired by Blockheating around the world, to expand the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Internet‚Äô in a regenerative way.

		<title>Into the Fold ‚Äì The ThreeFold Movement</title>
		<published>2021-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/the-threefold-movement/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not by mistake that you‚Äôre here, reading this post. You, like I, understand that today‚Äôs systems need to change. You know¬†that decentralization is needed for better wealth distribution and equal opportunities. And that we need better solutions for our planet. You can feel that a global shift is happening. And you want to do something about it. You want to be a part of it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
You‚Äôve¬†dreamt of a different world. A world where people trust and treat each other with respect ‚Äì and where everyone has equal chances to learn and to thrive. A world where we‚Äôre not just cogs in a machine that serves only the few, rather we work and co-create¬†as part of systems that benefit all. A world where solutions are sustainable for our planet, or even better, regenerative. This world is not just a dream, though ‚Äì and you‚Äôre not alone. Each day, more and more like-minded people are coming together. Welcome into the fold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;meet-the-movement&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#meet-the-movement&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: meet-the-movement&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Meet the Movement&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand ThreeFold, you should first understand where we came from.¬†Since the late 90‚Äôs, some of the ThreeFold co-founders have worked on Internet storage and cloud technology. And after years of building, and many successful launches, they came to understand that they were part of a broken system that was productizing people and damaging the planet. Despite this, they knew that the Internet held and holds the key to a better world, and that the only way to have a truly sovereign, secure, and energy-efficient Internet was to start from scratch. So we did.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This is how our story began ‚Äì and over the past four years we have grown and expanded a team of like-minded and passionate people from around the world to bring ThreeFold to life.¬†But for us, we are still in the beginning of something much bigger to come.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We don‚Äôt consider ourselves a company, rather a group of humans helping other humans ‚Äì and our planet. We believe the world needs to change, and we choose to not just talk, but act, to make that change happen. We cannot and would not want to do this alone. There is a strong, passionate, and growing community around us ‚Äì partners, farmers, ambassadors, technology testers, other contributors, and supporters just like you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-mission-vision-and-values-drive-us-forward&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#our-mission-vision-and-values-drive-us-forward&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: our-mission-vision-and-values-drive-us-forward&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Our Mission, Vision, and Values Drive us Forward&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to build and expand a data-sovereign and planet-positive Internet owned by the people, for the people. This will enable equal chances for people around the world to learn, partake and succeed, and will help to heal our planet.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Engrained into the work that we do are three key values or principles:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe in &lt;strong&gt;sovereignty&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and in protecting people. Everyone should own their data, and no one else, not even ThreeFold. Our peer-to-peer technology allows every user to be data sovereign ‚Äì¬†giving them 100% control over their data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe that everyone should be given &lt;strong&gt;equal chances&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to learn, partake and succeed. Internet access is a human right, and at ThreeFold we commit to scale our technology to new regions to empower the unconnected.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And we unify our practices, partnerships, and products around a single mission ‚Äì to &lt;strong&gt;heal our planet&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. By making our technology actionable, we enable a collective approach to have an impact together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;together-we-invite-the-world-into-the-fold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#together-we-invite-the-world-into-the-fold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: together-we-invite-the-world-into-the-fold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Together, We Invite the World Into the Fold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs important for others to understand who we are. Thus, we identify with and embody three key attributes as a collective, to show the world what the movement is all about:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ThreeFold is purposeful.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;¬†We exist¬†to help humanity thrive. Our mission is bold and motivates every step we take. We adapt to our evolving environment and passionately strive for excellence.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ThreeFold is empowering.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;¬†We help¬†people find themselves and do what they love. We provide support to people and projects that help build a better world, whether they have moonshot visions or down-to-earth ambitions. We aren‚Äôt the hero of our story ‚Äì they are.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ThreeFold is approachable.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;¬†ThreeFold keeps it real. We‚Äôre open and honest, avoiding upstage corporate language and phony marketing spins. We don‚Äôt see ourselves as a company, but more like humans helping other humans. So being genuine, friendly, and loving comes naturally.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In its essence, the movement is open and inviting. We‚Äôve created &lt;strong&gt;a participatory Internet economy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, where anybody around the world can plug in a 3Node and add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.¬†Together, we‚Äôre expanding a data sovereign and planet positive Internet infrastructure, owned by the people, across geographical and cultural borders.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe in &lt;strong&gt;collaboration, not competition&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Our technology serves as a responsible underlying layer on top of which anybody can build and create. We have &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&quot;&gt;beautiful partners&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; already on board ‚Äì and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;aci&quot;&gt;an alliance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of conscious people and organizations who share our vision ‚Äì and we are constantly expanding our ecosystem across industries.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And while the ThreeFold Foundation is currently the driving force behind the ThreeFold Movement, we believe in &lt;strong&gt;decentralization&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. We have open channels like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&quot;&gt;a¬†forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;a two-way Telegram chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Github (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldfoundation&quot;&gt;Foundation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Tech&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;threefold_io&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where people can and do contribute,¬†ask questions and provide feedback that goes into our everyday decision-making and actions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As I said at the start, you‚Äôve dreamt of a different world. And so have I. John Lennon once said, ‚ÄúA dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.‚Äù¬†Thank you for dreaming with us.¬†Together, this will happen!

		<title>The ThreeFold Grid is by the People, For the People</title>
		<published>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tf-grid-peoples-internet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when you hear the word Internet? For many, it‚Äôs the websites and applications we consume online as end users. But the Internet is much more than this. And ultimately,¬†every action we take online goes through a complex set of automated processes and protocols to store, run, and transmit data (e.g. photos, videos, messages, other files) across the global Internet infrastructure.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, this infrastructure consists of massive, power-hungry data centers, and¬†is largely privatized and owned by tech giants such as¬†Facebook, Google and Amazon ‚Äì who also happen to own the biggest online ‚Äúfree‚Äù platforms. But there‚Äôs a catch. By owning both the infrastructure and the digital experiences we consume for free, we were actually turned into products of their business models. Our data is being collected and isn‚Äôt owned by us anymore. While data has become the most valuable commodity on earth, don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs wrong that we don‚Äôt own the value of our data today?¬†
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúToday, every individual is worth between US $1,000 and $20,000 online, per year. The Internet and Cloud Industry is worth trillions,¬†yet all this value is centralized to a handful of companies. This has to change.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold‚Äôs open source technology powers the peer-to-peer Internet revolution that holds the premise to disrupt the global Internet in many ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-internet-by-the-people&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-internet-by-the-people&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-internet-by-the-people&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An Internet By the People&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid is formed by people from all around the world that connect Internet capacity to a peer-to-peer Infrastructure owned by humanity. Together, we expand a data-sovereign and planet-positive Internet infrastructure that puts people back in control of their data, and their digital lives. ThreeFold‚Äôs infrastructure can store all of humanity‚Äôs data ‚Äì from personal data to public datasets and security archives ‚Äì and can run all emerging technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and Big Data ‚Äì with more efficiency and security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold flips the current data center model upside-down, and allows people around the globe¬†to connect Internet capacity¬†in the form of hardware, and earn income for it. This decentralized approach means that¬†anyone can¬†take part in the world‚Äôs largest and fastest growing economy ‚Äì the Internet and Cloud.¬†
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
You can see now how this new Internet is by the people, but how about the latter? What does the ThreeFold Grid enable?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-internet-for-the-people&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-internet-for-the-people&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-internet-for-the-people&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An Internet For the People&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now anyone, anywhere can connect to the ThreeFold Grid and use capacity with some key advantages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-world-where-we-own-the-value-of-our-data&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-world-where-we-own-the-value-of-our-data&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-world-where-we-own-the-value-of-our-data&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A World Where we Own the Value of Our Data&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, all of the data we create online sits inside of centralized data centers and we do not own it. ThreeFold turns terms &amp;amp; conditions on their head and gives us, the people, full control of our data rather than third parties. We can keep our data private, decide with whom to share it, and even decide on where it‚Äôs stored and located. And considering that our personal data is worth between US $1,000 and $20,000 per year, ThreeFold offers a direct way for us to own our digital life and the value attached to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-exchange-value-without-intermediaries&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#we-exchange-value-without-intermediaries&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: we-exchange-value-without-intermediaries&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;We Exchange Value Without Intermediaries&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Internet‚Äù is peer-to-peer. This means connections between senders and recipients are completely end-to-end, eliminating the need for any form of intermediaries from the model. Can you imagine what the¬†world would look like without intermediaries? Let‚Äôs take an example like Airbnb.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, if you are looking for a place to stay on vacation, you will probably end up using the services of Airbnb. But did you know that Airbnb charges both consumers and property owners for using their service? In a peer-to-peer world, this wouldn‚Äôt be necessary. You‚Äôd simply access a database of property owners (possibly through a peer-to-peer marketplace) and be able to complete the transaction yourselves. No hidden fees, just a direct exchange of value!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-run-on-the-edge&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#applications-run-on-the-edge&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: applications-run-on-the-edge&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Applications Run on the Edge&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its essence, edge computing brings compute and storage closer to people (and the devices where it‚Äôs being gathered) rather than relying on a centralized data centers located on the other side of the planet. This is the essence of the ThreeFold Grid. So, data¬†doesn‚Äôt suffer any latency issues (performance) and it‚Äôs far more efficient &#x2F; money-saving. Further, the distributed nature of the Grid allows for true privacy and security. Edge computing is not just a growing trend but, because of the growing number of connected devices and global Internet usage, it‚Äôs becoming a real necessity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-about-the-planet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#but-what-about-the-planet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: but-what-about-the-planet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;But what about the planet?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve been following us, you must already know that the Internet is responsible for 10% or more of the world‚Äôs energy consumption. And with decades of experience in the Internet and Cloud industry, ThreeFold co-founders knew how to turn this around. We developed a lightweight operating system and infrastructure, removing unnecessary layers of complexity from the traditional and Web3 models (actually, blockchains are making it even more complex). The ThreeFold technology is always geared towards maximum efficiency while maintaing performance. And with these advancements, we can already save up-to 90% energy on storage workloads.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Additionally, the distributed nature of the Grid uses less bandwidth (see above re: edge computing). It‚Äôs been reported¬†that Netflix alone takes up 15% of the Internet‚Äôs bandwidth. What if Netflix were to leverage the ThreeFold Grid? If stored closer to watchers, we could reduce network usage considerably.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our commitment to the planet goes beyond the technology. Through a partnership¬†with Take Action Global (TAG), we aim to take three times more CO2 out of the air compared to what we put in. Imagine regenerating the earth while using the Internet?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
At ThreeFold, we believe that it‚Äôs time for us to take back control. As the world turns more and more digital due to the pandemic and even just the natural progression of technology, it‚Äôs time that we not just realize the problems of today‚Äôs Internet, but that we do something about it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This will happen! So join in, and spread the word!¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/internet-destroying-brain/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I came across &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;strategy&#x2F;the-internet-is-destroying-our-brains-but-we-cant-quit-its-a-factory-were-forced-to&#x2F;z4drxf5&quot;&gt;a poignant article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; written by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_pem_pem&quot;&gt;P.E. Moskowitz&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;¬†entitled ‚ÄúThe internet is destroying our brains, but we can‚Äôt quit. It‚Äôs a factory we‚Äôre forced to work in without any pay.‚Äù As someone who started out in¬†social media advertising (read: trying to capture peoples‚Äô attention to get them to buy or do something often by using their data against them), worked in influencer marketing in its early days, and has now gone 180¬∫ to help to build a decentralized Internet by people and for people (where people are digitally sovereign), it really resonated with me.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
It‚Äôs commonly-discussed (see: The Social Dilemma) and quite obvious if you use or have used the Internet and specifically social media, that we are addicted to being online. In fact, we‚Äôre actually even chemically triggered by social media and other online experiences. Said Jeff Orlowski, director of The Social Dilemma, ‚ÄúSocial media powerhouses like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to exploit users‚Äô brain chemistry in order to keep them glued to their phones‚Ä¶ They were designed to get us to come back. It‚Äôs to figure out how to reverse-engineer what we‚Äôre most vulnerable to, most susceptible to, to come back. And what we are seeing is a dopamine response in the brain.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In their article, Moskowitz points out how the Internet is¬†not just like a toxic relationship or junk food, where you can leave or stop yourself from eating, rather it‚Äôs ‚Äúan all-encompassing technology, our main economic engine, the tool we are forced to use to meet others and mediate our entire lives.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The truth is that the Internet &lt;em&gt;has&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; become more than an addiction, it‚Äôs become a necessity to keep up in today‚Äôs increasingly-digital world. Yet the Internet is not even accessible to about 40% of the global population ‚Äì and for those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have access, it does not serve us. It‚Äôs actually the other way around. We are the product.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúWe produce the memes, tweets, posts, and pictures that keep us tethered to the internet, and then that¬†content is monetized¬†in the form of advertisements - revenue users help produce, but do not usually see a penny of,‚Äù says Moskowitz. We have become cogs in a machine that uses us for its own benefit. Or as they call¬†it, ‚Äúa factory we‚Äôre forced to work in without any pay.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúOur entire society has been reformulated around the internet, much like it was centered around the factory during the Industrial Revolution. If there‚Äôs an¬†Amazon Web Services outage, much of our society stops functioning. Without the internet, we couldn‚Äôt find jobs, or, at this point, even friends.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-do-we-do&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-do-we-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-do-we-do&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So, what do we do?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moskowitz is correct in their thinking when they say¬†the following, ‚ÄúA solution to our current internet-use crisis cannot come at an individual level anymore than one person quitting their job would solve capitalism‚Äôs poor working conditions. If we want any hope of making the internet less stressful, less back-breaking, and more fulfilling, content creators, gig economy workers, and even casual internet users need to push for a systemic solution.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Simply pending less time on the Internet or using certain apps instead of others is not going to make much of a difference in the end. There are billions of people on the Internet today to make up for the loss. And the underlying system is still massively flawed and can be manipulated. Bold, widespread, systemic change¬†is indeed what we need. A revolution, perhaps.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out recently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tgdaily.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;6-dfinity-threefold-are-leading-an-internet-decentralization-revolution&#x2F;&quot;&gt;in TGDaily&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold is that revolution.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold is the engine for a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Internet, driven by a movement of people who care about a better future. With more than two decades of direct knowledge of the Internet and Cloud industries, we flipped today‚Äôs Internet on its head. We rebuilt the architecture from the ground up, with people and our planet at the center of our focus. Instead of relying on centralized hyper-scale data centers owned by a few private corporations, we provide the opportunity for people across the world with access to a network connection and electricity to plug in hardware and provide local capacity, and earn income while they are at it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In our model, we prioritize simplicity, security, efficiency, and privacy. The technology runs autonomously, removing human error and malicious intent from the equation. Connections are peer-to-peer, meaning no middlemen get in the way of our content, our transactions, or other data. And importantly, people own their data. What we produce is ours. We decide where it gets stored and we decide who can access it (and for what value). In fact,¬†it‚Äôs basically impossible from a technical standpoint for anybody to access someone‚Äôs data without their consent ‚Äì including us.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
On top of the technology, we¬†provide experiences. People will have one single log-in and verifiable identity, and gain access to the tools (experiences) they need for communication and for work. As we are a decentralized movement, soon, anybody will be able to build anything they like on top of ThreeFold ‚Äì but it is our vision and belief¬†that the Internet should not be addictive. Rather a tool for all of humanity to connect, learn, and prosper ‚Äì with people at the center, not treated as products.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To the author‚Äôs concern, content creators and gig economy workers would clearly benefit from such a digital world as well. Of course services like Airbnb or Uber or Etsy or even YouTube provide value as they are crowded marketplaces both for providers and customers. That said, they profit from people, typically on both sides of the transaction. In a peer-to-peer world, we can create fair and equal marketplaces where the content or product is owned completely by the person listing it there and the value goes 100% directly from person to person. This means no hidden fees, no uncertainty over ownership, no censorship or control from a third party. Of course it‚Äôs not all predetermined at this moment, but what I can say is that our biggest concerns in what we create are and will always be fairness and equality (and sustainability &#x2F; regeneration). So, together, we will bring all of this tolife in the best interest of people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-the-movement&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#join-the-movement&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: join-the-movement&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Join the Movement&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their article, Moskowitz concluded that ‚Äúperhaps it is only a matter of time before enough of us say ‚Äòenough,‚Äô and protest the internet‚Äôs totalizing grasp on our labor and our lives.‚Äù But where does protest lead without a viable solution? Maybe this is the type of systemic change Moskowitz could imagine and could stand behind. It‚Äôs not a band-aid approach, rather a total¬†re-imagination and re-execution of today‚Äôs flawed and manipulative Internet. It‚Äôs an Internet by people, for people. Instead of working in the factory, we become the factory co-owners ‚Äì and the Internet works for us.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
If you believe in what we are building, we invite you to join the movement:

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The United Nations publicly ruled Internet access to be a human right in 2016. Proper access to the Internet helps to protect people‚Äôs freedom of speech and thought, as well as other fundamentals such as access to knowledge and information.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Nonetheless, as of 2019, about 43% of humanity remains unconnected to the Internet, creating huge inequalities in access to information and knowledge. It is essential to take the necessary steps to strengthen the relationship between governments and people while still upholding all human rights.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold created an infrastructure that is easily affordable and jointly operated by network peers to make the modern Internet open and fair to everyone. Anybody with a network connection and electricity can add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. We‚Äôre looking for farmers around the globe and we‚Äôre also partnering with farming cooperatives to develop localized strategies and meet the specific needs of their region. Plus, the Foundation will incentivize and sponsor the extension and scope to areas that require Internet capacity the most, to ensure a fair and equitable delivery of the Internet to all.

&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week after week, month after month, year after year, companies are being hacked, private consumer data is being compromised and released, and we somehow begin to think¬†that this is the reality of our world, something we just have to deal with.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Internet security, cyber attacks, and data leaks are a global threat ‚Äì and increasingly so as the world moves more digital, and smart people with malicious intent try to take advantage. But this is not normal, nor should it be. As consumers, we should be able to trust that our data is truly safe and secure. And today, we cannot. It‚Äôs time we stand up for what is ours.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That‚Äôs where ThreeFold comes in.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Many of today‚Äôs issues around cyber security and data privacy come from the lack of innovation in the IT industry over the last decades and the reliance on centralized hyper-scale data centers. ThreeFold has disrupted this model in a few ways:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
First, we started from the ground up. Some ThreeFold co-founders have been working in the cloud &amp;amp; storage space for over two decades, having built components of the cloud and Internet still used today. They knew that the only way to have a truly secure and data sovereign Internet was to rebuild the architecture and the technology components from scratch. So they did. A few years down the line,¬†we‚Äôve created a new operating system, a smart contract for IT, and a peer-to-peer network that can be scaled to anywhere by anyone.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Second, we removed people from the equation. IT has become so overly-complex that people are required in order to maintain it. Because of this, ‚Äúbackdoors‚Äù are needed to allow these gateholders to enter the systems and make necessary fixes. But this can lead to human error, and also allows people with malicious intent to make their way in as well.¬†With Autonomous IT powering the ThreeFold Grid, the technology runs and heals itself, and drastically reduces the opportunity for humans to interfere.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And lastly, your data is owned by you. Rather than relying on centralized data centers, the ThreeFold Grid is an Internet grid made up by independent ThreeFold ‚ÄúFarmers‚Äù from around the world who plug in capacity from their home or office. While they own the hardware, they do not own the data inside. User data is stored across multiple devices, and proprietary data storage algorithms ensure that the data cannot be retrieved by anyone besides the user ‚Äì not the farmer, and not even us.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As Einstein said, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a lot more information in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our wikis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about the technology, but what we want to emphasize here with you is that we don‚Äôt have to accept data leaks and hacking. There¬†is¬†an answer to the cybersecurity issues the world is facing. And that answer is ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>How You Can Join the People&#x27;s Internet</title>
		<published>2021-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/join-the-peoples-internet/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/join-the-peoples-internet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, that‚Äôs right. With ThreeFold, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;¬†become the Internet! Let me quickly explain.¬†
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today‚Äôs Internet is powered by hyper-scale data centers which are owned by large corporations. With +80% of the global infrastructure and +60% of the global Internet networks owned by a bunch of companies, the Internet became a real business with us humans being the products of that business model.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold creates an entirely new Internet economy that is owned by all of us and makes the traditional cloud model of building data centers obsolete. With ThreeFold,¬†independent people called ‚ÄúFarmers‚Äù plug in 3Nodes (hardware) from their homes or offices anywhere around the world. And they earn income for it. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Together, they power a new, data-sovereign, and planet-positive Internet owned and powered by the people. This is a game-changer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So, how do I get a 3Node?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy one of the ready-made nodes¬†from cooperatives around the world.¬†This is a good and very easy way to support the ThreeFold project and to ‚ÄúBE THE INTERNET.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today you can buy a 3Node via our website. We are also working with our farming cooperatives to decentralize the provisioning and distribution of hardware to a glocal approach (a global network of local networks).¬†
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
But what if 3Nodes are not immediately available?¬†For example, last week we had a huge influx of orders for our Titan V2 3Nodes and sold out the entire batch with 3,000 extra orders. We‚Äôre now talking with many hardware distributors to make sure we can satsify all these orders, but this could take a while.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So if you are a little bit more adventurous, and want to build your 3Node from the ground up, yourself, here‚Äôs how to do it:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To ‚Äúbecome the Internet‚Äù is fairly simple (but does take some technical knowledge and effort).¬†Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A computer with an INTEL or AMD brain, some memory, and some storage cabilities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A smartphone on which you can download and run the ‚ÄúThreeFold Connect‚Äù app.¬†This will provide you with a wallet (to receive your farmed TFT and to pay a very small amount of TFT to get started).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A laptop &#x2F; desktop (and USB stick) to launch your online 3Bot, configure your farm, download your bootloader and burn the bootloader to a USB stick.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some technical knowledge, interest and 45 minutes of time.

		<title>A Smart Contract for all IT workloads</title>
		<published>2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/smart-contract-blog/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/smart-contract-blog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold was inspired by the blockchain burst when it was created in 2016. After doing a comprehensive scan of the technological space we realized that Blockchain holds the best technology to store (1) Smart Contracts and (2) Transactions in an immutable way. We created our own blockchain database: Rivine to host the Smart Contract layer before switching to the Parity Substrate of Polkadot and our Transactional blockchain to the Stellar Network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While we use blockchain technology, ThreeFold is much more than just ‚Äúa blockchain project‚Äù as we apply many more revolutionary technologies. We decided to use Parity Substrate as we don‚Äôt see the need to create something if there‚Äôs already great technologies out there that we can already use. Today we‚Äôre proud of our Smart Contract for IT layer and approach the ThreeFold Grid v3.0 release this year which will expose its full potential to interact with the primitives of the grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is this Smart Contract for IT about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smart Contract for IT allows you, your company or your community to execute the storage and running of your files and applications securely with consensus and automatic billing. You could compare it as a fingerprint check and your data would be accessible only if presenting your private key (fingerprint). Let‚Äôs maybe go through the process for a better idea of how this works.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The smart contracts are like recipes for chefs to cook exactly what you want. In that sense they need to be very accurate and as descriptive as possible to deliver what you need. In the case of ThreeFold, the smart contracts would define different sets of Internet resources you would need to store files, run applications, or communicate across the network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Whenever you want to reserve more resources to store your latest album or run your applications, you will define the resources you need to your 3Bot or Digital Twin (your personal virtual system administrators) which will then look at different smart contracts that are available and choose the most appropriate package. For e.g. Reserve 3 PB of Storage in Switzerland across 7 nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Following that, your 3Bot or Digital Twin will create and register the smart contract in the blockchain database in a few seconds, providing you with all your specific needs. It will also store and secure some instructions to the BCDB for the nodes to meet smart contract completion. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold had to make sure that user data would remain ultra-secure. Inspired by storage and communication algorithms used in space, we integrated it between the Smart Contract layer and Zero OS. The algorithm splits data into unrecognizable ‚Äòslices‚Äô that are distributed via network connections to different nodes locally or across the world, and that can be reconstructed only with your fingerprint. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;More than the average Smart Contract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via your Smart Contract for IT, you can also define a consensus mechanism and create multi-signatures for smart contract execution or completion to deliver appropriate digital services in for example work related activities. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The beauty of the Smart Contract for IT is that it can work with thousands of connected nodes for the proper execution of any digital requirements on the infrastructure, verify if consensus was reached or not, download the right files to execute the smart contract and verify them, make sure that no hacker or outsider can ever gain access or influence its execution and more. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>How ThreeFold offers Data Sovereignty</title>
		<published>2021-05-23T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-data-sovereignty/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôve seen &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uaaC57tcci0&quot;&gt;The Social Dilemma&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, you know all too well that today, people are being turned into products. Everything we do online ‚Äì all of the data we upload and all of our digital activities ‚Äì is tracked and oftentimes used against us. Targeted advertising is just the beginning.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Personal data is used by algorithms to make incredible important decisions, like whether someone should receive financial or health support or benefits. In China, people are now even receiving ‚Äúscores‚Äù for their behaviors. It sounds like Black Mirror, but it‚Äôs real life.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That‚Äôs the scary part. The good news is that things don‚Äôt have to be this way. ThreeFold is building the engine for an Internet where people can finally be data sovereign.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__why_intro?id=everyone-should-be-autonomous&quot;&gt;today‚Äôs Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, infrastructure is centralized. Companies provide services in exchange for your personal data, which is stored on servers in hyper-scale data centers owned by private companies.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In ThreeFold‚Äôs model, those servers are called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__3node&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and rather than sitting inside centralized data centers, they sit inside the homes or offices (or small data centers) owned by independent people and organizations called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro?id=what-is-3node&quot;&gt;Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. But the data inside is owned by the person or persons who put it there. They maintain access right as well. From a technical standpoint, data is dispersed across 3Nodes by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__part5_ultra_efficient_storage?id=the-space-algorithm-of-storage&quot;&gt;an algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that makes it such that nobody can access it. In addition, connections are peer-to-peer, meaning data goes directly between sender and recipient rather than passing through intermediaries as it does today ‚Äì bringing further levels of security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Thus, people can finally be data sovereign, knowing their data is safe, and truly theirs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>A Scalable and Secure Operating System</title>
		<published>2021-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/zero-os-blog/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/zero-os-blog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just like a brain is an interconnected network of neurons, the Internet (or internet) is a global interconnected network of computers and devices that communicate with each other via the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_protocol_suite&quot;&gt;Internet protocol suite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TCP&#x2F;IP). The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To create a new Internet from scratch, ThreeFold had to start at the operating system (OS) level. An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. And this is how Zero OS was born &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-zero-os-special&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-makes-zero-os-special&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-makes-zero-os-special&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What makes Zero OS special?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero OS is a stateless and lightweight operating system. Given it has no shell, remote or server interface, it is much safer than the big majority of the OSs on the market. When storing your data on Zero OS, it is fingerprinted and made available only when requested by you or those you provide access to.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The state of an application represents its state of being in a given moment in time. Think of a stateless transaction as vending machines, a single request and a response. In ThreeFold‚Äôs Internet infrastructure, this can be represented as data being accessible only when requested. 
The only way to access data on Zero OS is via the private key (or fingerprint) of a user. In that sense, the data is not accessible unless the data owner requests access to it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does Zero OS apply to developers?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its lightweight architecture, Zero OS is a perfect fit to run microservice architectures and emerging IT workloads such as IoT, Blockchains, Big Data, and more. A key benefit of microservice architecture is the freedom it offers you to choose the best runtime for the task at hand. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Let‚Äôs take the example of decentralizing service-oriented developing teams. A common challenge there is that most of the time they don‚Äôt really understand the applications they are exposing. But no one knows the data infrastructure of the applications better than those who craft them. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold permits decentralized developer teams with the ability to share keys (access) to the developing environment on Zero OS and the gateways to the world wide web within the secure peer-to-peer overlay network. This is game changing. Also with all the automation frameworks provided, it creates the perfect environment to develop current and emerging technologies. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Put shortly, decentralized development and integration is now officially an organizational or cultural change, not a technical one anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zero OS allows anyone to provide sovereign capacity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given stateless systems separate the OS configuration and user data, Zero OS simplifies the  maintenance and the deployment of digital workloads, while making it impossible to hack into user data on a hardware level. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
3Nodes provide all the storage, compute and network primitives for a new internet infrastructure. Given they are booted with Zero OS, anyone can now participate in the Internet economy without jeopardizing user data sovereignty and security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Conclusively, Zero OS is ultra secure, perfect to develop current and future technologies, and enables anyone to take part in the planet positive and data sovereign Internet brought by ThreeFold.

		<title>ThreeFold‚Äôs Planet Positive Plan</title>
		<published>2021-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no question that climate change is one of the biggest, if not the biggest threats facing humanity today. If we care at all about future generations and the health of our planet, we have no choice but to address these threats, and fast. That‚Äôs why one of our biggest aims is to lower the energy usage of our digital lives. But ThreeFold is taking not just a sustainable approach, we‚Äôre setting the plan for a planet positive Internet.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Recently, we released information on how our infrastructure saves up-to-90% on energy consumption compared to existing models. We achieve this mainly thanks to an extremely efficient storage system and the concept of a Digital Twin.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
From &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_storage&quot;&gt;a storage standpoint&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we reduce energy by avoiding copies, implementing a multi-layer system, not using fast disks, through read&#x2F;write caching, and more. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_digital_twin&quot;&gt;Digital Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we have taken a very different approach to how we exist in today‚Äôs digital world. Rather than existing 100 times in a huge system of client-server architecture, now we exist only once. We believe that we can run 25 Digital Twins with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__bulb_comparison_twin&quot;&gt;the same energy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as used by one light bulb.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Saving energy is one thing, but there will still be remaining energy. This needs to be offset by carbon credits. Now, in order to regenerate our planet, we &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__carbon_negative&quot;&gt;work together with Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to let students farm carbon credits. This has the potential to offset energy usage 100% by the end of 2021, and we have, as an aim to take 2x more carbon out of the air than we put in.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our planet needs better solutions across industries. No more talking. Now is the time to act.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>A Better Understanding of Wealth</title>
		<published>2021-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/a-better-understanding-of-wealth/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/a-better-understanding-of-wealth/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-better-understanding-of-wealth&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-better-understanding-of-wealth&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-better-understanding-of-wealth&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A better understanding of wealth&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is more than the accumulation of money and resources. It can be generated in ways other than through conventional financial means. The financial justice warrior, Bernard Liataer, highlighted that to capture the wealth of our societies, our culture and our environments, we have to pay heed to the notion of wealth as well-being.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we obtain that well-being? We all know the answer to this question ‚Äì we have a sense of well-being when all of our needs are met. It is not just the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter but also the need to be a creative participant in our community, have a voice in our own destiny, and pursue our own spiritual development unhindered by social sanction. Developing real wealth implies making choices that enable all members of the community to attain well-being. Achieving sustainable wealth implies meeting the present‚Äôs needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Twin has been created while taking into consideration the different types of community capital that need to be achieved to create real wealth:¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural Capital - It includes the community environment that produces more assets. Our today‚Äôs economies failed to measure, understand and account for the true value of nature‚Äôs riches - clean air and water, soil and pollination for food, the social, intrinsic and spiritual values of natural beauty. Digital Twin will be the tool for us to place a proper value on Natural capital finally.¬†&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological Capital ‚Äì It includes how we harness our intellectual resources to create tools, systems, machines, arts, skills, and materials designed to improve our lives. This is what Digital Twin is all about - providing the required technology to enhance our lives and those of our communities‚Äô members through collective efforts and intelligence. Digital Twin is only the foundation for this future global well-being. People will support education and creativity throughout the world and give access to material information¬†required to create additional innovative technologies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Capital ‚Äì It recognizes the economic importance of all the ways we are connected: the relationships, our networks and values we share and the cooperative systems, and all its different components we use for interacting. Nowadays, our social capital is threatened through the repetitive act of violence, betrayal of trust, exclusion or less sharing and caring towards our fellow humans. Digital Twin has been created to encourage the easy sharing and exchange of resources and cooperate with each other on a platform.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical and Cultural Capital ‚Äì Through history, we have learned, and now we are transmitting our cultural understanding and recommendation about the economic and financial system to others through an open-source, public and transparent peer-to-peer exchange protocol.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Capital ‚Äì It includes all capabilities that people have to learn, invent, create, work, care for each other, and contribute to the community. This is the reason why Digital Twin has been created - A project to benefit us all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Capital ‚Äì It is the creation of real wealth through the availability of liquidity resources through a multi-currency system and Savings &amp;amp; Investments made by individuals and institutions. By strengthening and increasing this type of capital, our peer-to-peer platform believes that it is the obvious path to a successful economic development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these forms of capital produce the critical flows of assets through the economic system. Capital is the foundation, the reproductive system, the greenhouse that grows a healthy economy. This has been one of the fundamental beliefs of Digital Twin - For the well-being of worldwide communities.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever with this global pandemic happening since late 2019, our lives are being shaped by our interaction with the digital world - work meetings on Zoom followed by Skype or Messenger Video Call with your family before a quick run with your favourite running app and a google search for your next meal. Technologies and services offer us a lot and greatly improve our daily lives. But what‚Äôs the real cost of these tools we rely on so much?¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies, especially those offering free services, collect data about you. It might be data you knowingly and willingly share to enjoy the benefits of the service (name, age, email address,..) or data that you might not realize you are sharing, like your approximate location through your IP address or your social network identifier or apps accessing your contacts.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of this data, and its collection, may appear harmless to some, what happens behind the scenes is a real source of concern as the data collection is only the first step in a long and opaque process. Adtech companies combine this information and create an assumed picture of you that we may call a digital doppelganger - Your ‚Äúdigital secret identity‚Äù. Actually, you may have hundreds or thousands of different doppelgangers held¬†by companies you‚Äôve never heard of.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data are so valuable that big tech giants spend so much time and effort building the platform that is useful for us and giving those platforms to us for free. Well, this data is collected for a single purpose: to better predict your behaviour and target you with ads.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real example:¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a person who has never talked about their political views online, never shared anything related to politics, never donated any money and never mentioned anything even in their private emails. Now the algorithms models that had been developed can analyse his&#x2F;her Facebook likes or the music he&#x2F;she listen to and with high accuracy can predict their political affiliation, and then being the target of unnecessary ads.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: This is not only for political affiliation. It stands out for every products and service¬†using these marketing tools.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology isn‚Äôt just hardware and software; it‚Äôs a fundamental component of every aspect of our lives and society. Inventions need to be created with social impact in mind. The invention should not be driven solely by profit, and the long-term effects should not be ignored¬†and unknowable.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not paying for it, you are not the customer. You are the product being sold. It‚Äôs a powerful phrase, a modern dialogue to get people rethinking their relationship to social media.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Digital Twin, regain your freedom where you will live your digital life securely and privately. Now, you will have one and unique digital identity to¬†interact in human-to-human way with your peers, edit, manage and store your documents, publish your web and make automatic payments.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Digital Twin, only you own your data and no one else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember when you could create your own safe space and decide what others see and know?¬†Now, whether you are at home, in the middle of a city, or hiking a mountain, you‚Äôre never really alone.¬†More and more, the technology we used is connected to the internet. Cars, fridges, energy meters, even baby monitors send out data about you and your family 24&#x2F;7 beyond your control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;behind-the-scene&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#behind-the-scene&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: behind-the-scene&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Behind the scene&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data is collected for spurious purposes: to better predict your behaviour and target you with ads. The targeted advertising ecosystem, using trackers included in the sites you visit and Software Development Kits (SDKs) in the apps you use, aims to get a better picture of you to present you with more relevant ads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The ad tech¬†ecosystem has one main feature: connecting companies to you through an opaque and technically complex infrastructure, allowing almost anyone to enter the data collection and exchange market. Moreover, this means any companies can participate in processes such as Real-Time Bidding (an¬†automated process that enables advertisers to target particular groups of people on different websites, videos, apps without having to negotiate prices directly), only to collect data and never display ads.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that companies, such as two AdTech companies that track your activities on a different set of sites, can grab data from each other to consolidate the data and profiles they have on people. Consequently, companies participating in this ecosystem (or sometimes on their own) can sell your data to clients that may not be using it to try and sell you stuff. This is the unhealthy and unsustainable digital cycle that we live in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these examples, it is not hard to imagine that your personal data can be used to influence the price of products and services proposed to¬†you, particularly from companies and institutions.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs join forces together and, as a community, reclaim our freedom and get back ownership of your data. With Digital Twin, you are at the centre¬†of your digital world. No one else.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, more than 40% of the world is without access to the internet, a tool which brings incredible access to knowledge (education) and important information, communication tools that keep loved ones connected and are crucial for emergencies, and economic opportunities. And over the last year, as the world is spending more time at home, digital economies are booming and education is going remote. With an uncertain future, we need to fix¬†the digital divide or we risk leaving billions of people even further behind.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-data-center-problem-cost-proximity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-data-center-problem-cost-proximity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-data-center-problem-cost-proximity&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Data Center Problem: Cost &amp;amp; Proximity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The centralized data centers that power today‚Äôs Internet are located ‚Äústrategically‚Äù mainly in¬†North America, Europe, and select parts of Asia. For populations living in these regions, Internet is accessible and generally relatively affordable. But the further you travel from these data centers, the less available and more expensive the internet becomes. Internet access is mostly an issue Sub-saharan Africa, throughout¬†Asia, and some parts of South America.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Of course some data centers can be and are being¬†built in and near developing and remote regions,¬†but for reasons including cost and audience,¬†this hasn‚Äôt been a huge priority to date. Beyond that, the data center model as a whole simply cannot scale to meet the future demands of the internet nor is it sustainable for our planet, so this is not the right option.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-shutdown-problem-control-manipulation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-shutdown-problem-control-manipulation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-shutdown-problem-control-manipulation&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet Shutdown Problem: Control &amp;amp; Manipulation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of internet access isn‚Äôt always just an availability or affordability problem. Today‚Äôs internet can be limited or even shut down at any point, by the right people.¬†Take a quick look at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netblocks.org&#x2F;reports&quot;&gt;NetBlocks.org&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, an organization that reports on global internet disruptions or outages. Typically governments are enacting these measures during times of unrest or protest or¬† important political moments. Even in the United States, the Executive Branch of the government has &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.klemchuk.com&#x2F;ip-law-trends&#x2F;government-power-to-shut-down-the-internet&quot;&gt;the power to shut down the internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a case of a national emergency.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Cutting the internet or restricting certain services based on region (a common practice as well) is not only not right, it‚Äôs dangerous. People rely on the internet for information and communication and no government or entity should have the ability to shut the internet down at their discretion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-solution-fair-neutral-internet-for-all&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-solution-fair-neutral-internet-for-all&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-solution-fair-neutral-internet-for-all&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Solution: Fair &amp;amp; Neutral Internet for All&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the United Nations declared internet access to be a human right, yet today if you are reading this post, you are privileged. All humans deserve access to the internet and ThreeFold has the solution.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
With the ThreeFold model, nodes can be set up anywhere in the world where an existing internet connection and electricity are present. By putting physical infrastructure at the edge (close to users), greater levels of access can be reached.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Further, the ThreeFold Grid cannot be shut down or manipulated. It is a neutral internet owned by the people, where autonomous technology heals and runs itself and requires minimal human intervention.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today we are working with partners in the clean energy and network &#x2F; connectivity to build the solutions that are needed to provide fair and uninterrupted internet access with all corners of the world.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Of course we will need new safe, secure, and private solutions for people to collaborate online. Many of these are already live and deployable via¬†ThreeFold Now Community Solutions. We are working with partners in the education space as well to build toolsets for students to enrich their lives.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We need a more inclusive internet, and that is what we are building.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>What Is Peer-to-Peer and Why Is It so Important?</title>
		<published>2020-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/what-is-peer-to-peer/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/what-is-peer-to-peer/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is Peer-to-Peer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the¬†distributed computer application architecture where tasks and workloads are shared between peers, popularized by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a revolutionary file storing system from the late 1990s.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The concept inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P systems and groups are typically critical of authoritarian and centralized social structures and believe in equality, meritocracy, flat systems, participatory &amp;amp; circular economies, as the concept represents a concrete pathway to these outcomes or visions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
P2P systems are¬†network, not¬†linear or ‚Äòpyramidal‚Äô hierarchies (though they may share some elements). They are ‚Äòdistributed‚Äô, though they may have elements of ‚Äòcentralization‚Äô and ‚Äòdecentralization.‚Äô And intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does ThreeFold relate to peer-to-peer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs Peer-to-Peer¬†(P2P) computing network¬†is a distributed architecture that splits tasks and workloads between its¬†peers, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;what_is_farming&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Farmers are equal¬†participants in the network and together they form a peer-to-peer network of nodes, the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Farmers make¬†their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Farmers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional¬†&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Client-server&quot;&gt;client-server&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;¬†model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the near future, ThreeFold will create Digital Twin, which will go¬†beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources. It will actually enable much more than that. Digital Twin will create a complete new digital world with diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a¬†&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtual_community&quot;&gt;virtual community&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;¬†on the ThreeFold Grid. This will empower the network of peers¬†to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, and are beneficial to all the peers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why did ThreeFold choose peer-to-peer?¬†&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything starts (or should start) from the why, and the ThreeFold story started a long time ago. Before the inception of ThreeFold, many of the co-founders of the project used to work with the largest IT &amp;amp; Cloud actors. Throughout their experience working in the Industry, they realized that the complexity of the technology and the centralization of knowledge &amp;amp; power led to an inefficient, unsustainable, not scalable and unequally distributed infrastructure. So they decided to redesign the whole Internet and cloud infrastructure bottom-up with the vision of shaping a global internet economy that can scale anywhere efficiently, cost efficiently and sustainably.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why does the world needs peer-to-peer?¬†&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing the technology, the conviction that peer-to-peer was the best solution for humanity and the planet strengthened itself. Why? Well, put simply, a peer-to-peer system removes all forms of intermediaries, unnecessary steps and complexity from the picture. Therefore, it simplifies the architecture in an incredible way. The benefits are many but here are the most popular benefits:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Privacy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Our peer-to-peer environment means no middlemen or intermediaries, meaning data travels¬†directly between peers and stored on the nodes of their choice¬†rather than being sent through and stored by a third party.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Data stored in data centers is susceptible to security breaches. In bypassing data centers and exchanging data directly between peers, we can achieve much greater security as it reduces code and back doors significantly.¬†&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: In a many-to-many system, scale is essentially unlimited. There is simply no bottleneck. And hardware (nodes) can be added at ease compared to current data center model.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost-efficiency &amp;amp; Sustainability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: End-to-end (direct) connection between peers means a more efficient path for data and less energy is needed. Less energy means less cost, and less harm to our planet.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;In 2021 the world is going peer-to-peer!¬†&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre now in 4 years into the project, and it is clear that ThreeFold holds the most advanced technology and is probably the only tech company in the world that can achieve¬†a peer-to-peer network &amp;amp; digital world as envisioned by the concept authors. The ThreeFold Grid is running and already at it‚Äôs 2.4 version and 2021 will bring various commercial opportunities for the public to partake in the peer-to-peer network, from hosting IT workloads to experiencing P2P end-user solutions. In other words, in 2021, the world will be able to go peer-to-peer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>A Better Solution for Our Planet</title>
		<published>2020-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</published>

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, the global Internet and IT infrastructure requires enormous amounts of energy, responsible for about 10% of annual global energy consumption. This makes the IT industry amongst the most pollutive industries in the world (along with the often-discussed airline industry, for comparison).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe IT can be sustainable. Actually, it should be! That&#x27;s why energy efficiency has always been a key focus of ours. With climate change and sustainability as some of the most pressing issues of our times, new green solutions need to be our priority. It has been key to ThreeFold since the very beginning of its story to enable a technological infrastructure that can reduce the Internet‚Äôs carbon footprint drastically. 
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simplicity-is-the-key-to-unlock-a-better-future&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#simplicity-is-the-key-to-unlock-a-better-future&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: simplicity-is-the-key-to-unlock-a-better-future&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Simplicity is the key to unlock a better future&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, integration suites, middleware solutions, and enterprise service busses have been invented and implemented to cover integration challenges within the current internet. This has further complicated IT architectures, resulting in a loss of actual end user workload performance.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold reworked the whole approach to IT architectures and eliminated the layers of complexity. The result is a cloud stack that presents minimal overhead and that requires less hardware ‚Äì reducing heat generation and eventually cooling requirements. By reducing the need for power, the net result is an energy-efficient Internet grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;improving-resilience-and-efficiency-through-self-healing-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#improving-resilience-and-efficiency-through-self-healing-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: improving-resilience-and-efficiency-through-self-healing-it&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Improving resilience and efficiency through Self-Healing IT&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping systems up and running is a major requirement in modern day IT. Leading vendors earn most of their margin by selling maintenance contracts, performance guarantees, and professional services. Their business models bring no incentive to make things simple and efficient for consumers.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Creating a self-healing environment requires only minimal manual intervention to replace broken hardware components. Broken hardware components are inevitable, and the Zero-OS distributed node architecture deals with such failures by turning off broken components and provisioning unused capacity. By removing the need to ship broken parts back and forth, and linking to the corresponding installation knowledge (engineers), a lower carbon footprint can be achieved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-painkiller-approach-we-tackle-the-root-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#no-painkiller-approach-we-tackle-the-root-issue&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: no-painkiller-approach-we-tackle-the-root-issue&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;‚ÄúNo painkiller‚Äù approach. We tackle the root issue&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a specific piece of software or hardware is not delivering the required performance or reliability, we should analyze the core design&#x2F;algorithm and its usage of soft&#x2F;hard components to determine the root causes of persistent issues to be solved.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Currently, most storage vendors follow the path of least resistance when trying to improve on performance. Their solution for meeting performance targets is to use faster components (CPU, memory, network card, proprietary acceleration) rather than looking at the core algorithms that drive the utilization of those components. Swapping components for faster ones perpetuates a cycle of cutting corners and focuses reliance on innovation from hardware component providers rather than solving the more fundamental and underlying issues. That‚Äôs a ‚Äúpainkiller‚Äù approach.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Zero-OS was designed to solve root problem issues by design. While still using high-performance hardware components on the ThreeFold Grid, the algorithm of Zero-OS maximizes utilization possibilities. This enables greater performance and sustainability. Some key examples how this is achieved:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eliminating-unnecessary-elements-from-standard-architectures&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#eliminating-unnecessary-elements-from-standard-architectures&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: eliminating-unnecessary-elements-from-standard-architectures&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Eliminating unnecessary elements from standard architectures&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtualization adds a layer of software between the actual end-user workload and physical hardware. It also allows for multiple workloads to run on the same hardware by using excess capacity. There is definitely merit in building a virtualization solution. Building an effective virtualization solution that does not require abundant context switching is key and this is why Zero-OS has been developed. Zero-OS uses a minimal Linux kernel that allows for a number of user spaces to co-exist. In these user spaces, containerized versions of software can be run, eliminating the need for hypervisors, virtual OS to fuel the virtual machines, and guest operating systems. This also minimizes the required overhead for the host OS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supercomputing delivered many new technologies. But, not all of them are usable solutions for everyday workloads. One technology invented to make supercomputers performant is the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). RDMA allowed physical CPU boards (containing both CPUs and memory) to access other CPU boards in memory stored data over a dedicated channel. This eliminated the need to transport data between CPU nodes over network connections (or other mainstream means to exchange data). The result was a considerable reduction in overhead created when allowing distributed end user workloads to operate over multiple physical cores. The leading server and storage solutions brands have never considered nor implemented such mechanisms. This resulted in an increased need for faster networks - increasing complexity, costs, efforts and resources needed to operate solutions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
RDMA is only used in certified farms and requires involvement of TFTech.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storage solution uses slow and big (the bigger the better) HDD disks which drive in rack density. As they spin slower they consume less power and need less cooling. But then, how can you deal with read&#x2F;write intensive workloads? The storage algorithm uses a SSD cache to acknowledge Inputs&#x2F;Outputs coming from the applications, fills the erasure coded data blocks in large (up to 64MB) storage containers and writes the big chunks of data on the big and slow HHDs. If you are familiar with HDD disks, you know they like to be streamed on instead of having a lot of small bits written in a scratchy way.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Continuous innovation in all of these areas are leading to an efficient technology stack.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We are growing a green and responsible peer-to-peer Internet that is available everywhere and owned by everyone ‚Äî across geographical and cultural borders, empowering people to be digitally independent and providing equal chances to learn, partake and succeed.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;values-first&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#values-first&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: values-first&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Values-First&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ThreeFold, we are driven by three main values:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equality is the foundation for a fair world where everyone is given the opportunity to be empowered and to achieve their full potential.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freedom of thought, opinion, creativity and faith are fundamentals to achieve peace and fulfillment of humankind‚Äôs potential.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustainability ensures the future of life on earth. It is about adopting the behavior and mindset to minimize our footprint.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Let‚Äôs take a deeper look.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;internet-access-a-human-right&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#internet-access-a-human-right&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: internet-access-a-human-right&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Internet Access | A Human Right&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, the United Nations officially declared Internet access to be a human right. The right to internet access aims to protect people‚Äôs freedom of expression and opinion, as well as other fundamentals such as access to knowledge and information.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Yet as of today, about 48% of humanity remains unconnected to the Internet, creating huge inequalities in the access to information and knowledge. It is important that the right steps are taken to improve the relationship between governments and citizens and to uphold all human rights.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To make the new internet accessible and equal to all, ThreeFold built with ThreeFold Farmers an infrastructure that is affordable to all and collectively owned by the network peers. To ensure a fair and equal distribution of the internet to everyone, fully sponsored capacity will be deployed in remote regions of our world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-freedom-for-everyone&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#digital-freedom-for-everyone&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: digital-freedom-for-everyone&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Digital Freedom | For Everyone&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet evolved to become the world‚Äôs largest database of information and knowledge, opening up exponential growth on personal, organizational and economic levels. Yet it is owned by large international companies that exploits users data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The current approach of many governments and countries is to cut the Internet into pieces by limiting its accessibility and enforcing regulations. We need an internet that protects our digital freedom and fair access to global information for everyone, everywhere.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold is a peer-to-peer internet ‚Äî owned by the users. All the technology of this new internet is open-source and the whole experience is built around the fundamentals of a peer-to-peer network. On this new internet, everyone owns their data and experiences ‚Äî digital freedom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-green-internet-for-our-planet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-green-internet-for-our-planet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-green-internet-for-our-planet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A Green Internet | For Our Planet&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current internet consumes about 10% of global energy production. With the imminent boom of emerging technologies such as Blockchain, Internet of Things, Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence and 5G, the Internet‚Äôs energy consumption is expected to increase exponentially.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The current industry solutions focuses on increasing the use of renewable energies to power data centers. However this is not a viable solution as data centers consume enormous amounts of energy. Therefore, a new solution that can drastically reduce the global internet‚Äôs energy consumption is needed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold is the first true peer-to-peer Internet. It uses pioneering technologies that remove the need for centralized and power-hungry data centers, consumes 90% less energy, and uses 90% less international fibre network capacity.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
If not now, when? If not us, who?

&lt;p&gt;During a gathering with some friends, I noticed something that made me think about how important it is what we‚Äôre doing at ThreeFold.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
One of my friends was complaining about how he couldn‚Äôt log in to one of his social media platforms, because all of his passwords are different and he forgot which one he used for this particular platform. Another friend was saying how she tagged her sister on a funny meme, but her sister couldn‚Äôt find it on Facebook. Turns out she tagged her on Instagram. And then one of them said something that I keep hearing more and more from people, ‚ÄúWhy do we have so many apps, I can‚Äôt find anything anymore!‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We exist so many times online, but why? There is only one me in the real world. Why should there not be only one me online? Why should I have 25 different profiles on 25 different platforms, with 25 different logins, when I am unique?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That is another dilemma that ThreeFold has a solution for, with its autonomous technology. 3Bot - a digital avatar like no other, that basically handles your entire online life. The focus lies on digital privacy, where only you can access your data, and no one else. The 3Bot has all the functionalities you need to interact and exchange information and value, there will be no need for that many applications on your device anymore. With 3Bot, everything changes.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The 3Bot is built on the ThreeFold Grid, and has the same values as ThreeFold. Freedom, Equality, and Sustainability. It is important that your data is safe, and what can be safer than you being the only one who not only has access to it, but also the only one who owns that data? Your online world should not be that different from your offline world. In your offline world, you are the center of your own life. That is what ThreeFold is doing with the 3Bot, putting you in the center of your online life, too.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
One decentralized application, one digital wallet, one login and one you. Because you‚Äôre unique.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you seen ‚ÄòThe Great Hack‚Äô on Netflix? It‚Äôs a documentary about the Cambridge Analytica hacking scandal, where personal data of millions of peoples‚Äô Facebook profiles were harvested without their consent and used for political advertising purposes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While watching it, I couldn‚Äôt help but think how unfair it is that in today‚Äôs digital society, people are being treated like products, because there is no such thing as a ‚Äòfree‚Äô platform without YOU being the product. What did reassure me, is that people are sick of having their data used this way. But what they might not know, is that the internet problem is bigger than ‚Äòjust‚Äô data protection.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The Internet is growing at an exponential rate. To service this demand, a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today. However, the Internet is expanding much faster than datacenters and the planet can cope with. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition to that, the Internet is extremely centralized, with most of these data centers being located in the US. Think of it like electricity. If consumers in, for example, Turkey had to use electricity generated in the US, it would be too expensive and inefficient, because it is too far away. The transmission lines would be too strained and losses and repairs would make it unsustainable. Capacity is like electricity. When centralized, it becomes too expensive and wasteful for remote users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is the solution to these problems?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet needs to be more distributed, cost-effective, neutral, and sustainable. ThreeFold has developed such a new technology, the ThreeFold Grid (Grid) and a token which enables all this to happen.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Combining the values of the ThreeFold Foundation (freedom, equality and fairness) with the technology developed by TFTech (Zero-OS, Zero-Chain, 3Bot) and a digital currency called the ThreeFold Token (a decentralized digital currency and means of payment to exchange autonomous and decentralized Internet services)  we believe that we have all the tools in order to actually make a difference in tomorrow‚Äôs digital world. Question is, are you ready to join us?

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-history-on-blockchain-technology&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-little-history-on-blockchain-technology&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-little-history-on-blockchain-technology&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A little history on blockchain technology&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone thinks that Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain technology when he published his whitepaper in January 2009 to make a digital currency the first use case. But it was not!.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In 1991, Dr. W. Scott Stornetta published a white paper in which he introduced a ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô as a decentralized database where digital transactions are secured. The research focused on creating a digital hierarchy system that time-stamped and chronologically secured deals in a chain of blocks.  The first considered use case for blockchain technology was to sign and store land deeds digitally. The technology‚Äôs main characteristics were decentralization and immutability across the process of storing transaction data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Satoshi was the person (or part of a group of people) that used these blockchain principles to create the first digital currency - Bitcoin.  The rest is history, from one to many digital currencies based on different creation principles (also referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital coins, etc.) that have been launched and existed for over a decade and have begun to come more into the mainstream purview.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization-and-immutability&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization-and-immutability&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization-and-immutability&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization and immutability&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two characteristics that have spawned interest in Blockchain technology are decentralization and immutability. In the current world, centralization is everywhere, in most industries, governments, education systems, the world wide web (Internet), and more. All roads these days seem to lead to centralized setups.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Examples of centralized setups today:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monetary&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Fiat currencies are governed and controlled by central banks.  According to Wikipedia: ‚ÄúA central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state‚Äôs currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank has a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state and prints the national currency, which serves as the state‚Äôs legal tender. Central banks also act as a ‚Äúlender of last resort‚Äù to the banking sector during a financial crisis. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the solvency of member institutions, prevent bank runs, and prevent reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.‚Äú So central banks control fiat currencies, and other institutions control central banks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Wide Web (WWW)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The World Wide Web is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Although distributed by design, this technology shares and exposes globally developed information and centralized functions crucial to make this World Wide Web work: large (commercial) monopolies have developed centralized search facilities, e.g., yellow pages of the world wide web. These search facilities now control what you find when you are looking for a specific search term.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
There seems to be a natural ‚Äúdesire‚Äù to organize and create different things with central control. Probably the result of our (humankind) social models based on hierarchies and competition. These social models have influenced a lot of what we have built in the industrial and information revolution - creating centralization as the defacto standard of building anything.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Now that we have invented a technology that potentially can build different things without a lot of centralization, we need to be careful to use it for the right things.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-myths&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-myths&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-myths&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain myths&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate what potential right use cases exist for blockchain technologies, let spend some time on some of the blockchain myths created in recent years. Similar to other new technologies, blockchains market themselves as a miracle technology that overcomes many (if not any) of the challenges and difficulties that exist in modern-day digital technology. Let‚Äôs name and investigate a few.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains are ‚ÄúSuper Scalable‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they? Pure blockchain deployments are not super scalable compared to conventional (server-based) transaction methods.  Current financial blockchain transaction times are very slow compared to any other (currency) transaction technologies out there, being it card transactions like Mastercard, VISA, or money transfers from one bank account to another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain technology brings ‚ÄúImpeccable security.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very questionable! While blockchains use cryptographic standards, the methods to ensure privacy is entirely outside of any blockchain standards and implementations. It‚Äôs every implementer‚Äôs responsibility to ensure security, therefore mostly handled as it is in the old (conventional?) world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;When using Blockchains, ‚ÄúTrustworthiness is guaranteed.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By what? Blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and information storage, but otherwise, nothing is inherently trustworthy about any fact stored on the Blockchain. You need to corroborate trustworthiness by ensuring that the parties who store information in the Blockchain are incorruptible and that these facts are correct ‚Äîjust as you would in the rest of the world without using blockchain technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains can manage ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a protocol expressed in code, and this does not define in terms of any standard. There are no standards bodies to provide sanctioned implementation rules or guidance.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Many contracts or types of data are better dealt with not on a blockchain: as it is a database that has only write and read functionality, but no update nor deletion is possible, it‚Äôs even dangerous to post sensitive and personal data on a blockchain, and if not used well, there might raise conflicts with regulations such as GDPR. However, a blockchain can provide consensus where required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Smart contracts on the Blockchain can do ‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially but maybe not in the way how people see it today. While this is technically true, Blockchain is limited to well-understood and straightforward use cases, without ambiguities. Smart contracts are essentially rocket science. By design, once published (launched), you cannot revise or bug fix them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain-deployments-if-not-public-go-private&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-deployments-if-not-public-go-private&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-deployments-if-not-public-go-private&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain deployments ‚ÄúIf not public - go private!‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the same thing! Private blockchains are not the answer to privacy or restricted access to information. Purely private&#x2F;enterprise blockchains might fail to realize any of the benefits of Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A new feature, ‚Äújustifies deploying a new Blockchain.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community-driven blockchain products are being forked left and right by private players who enhance them in various ways. But only the open-source blockchains with the largest communities and install-plus-adoption bases will persist. The rest are mainly lab experiments, and 99.9 percent of these probably fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-myths-undone&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-myths-undone&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-myths-undone&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain myths undone&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Blockchain is a hyped new technology, but they are not the answer to everything.  Just like with any other technology or tool, you need to consider if the use case considered carefully is appropriate. In the end, it is only neutral characteristics that might be a reason for applying a blockchain or not:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a need for decentralization?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a need for immutability?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
When considering Blockchain technology for a specific purpose, proper due diligence should happen. This to determine the fit and implementing it if it enhances value for the organization. Humans play a vital role in the decision process and are required to find solutions for the flaws that blockchains bring along.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Scalability, security, trustworthiness, functionality are to be added by humans to blockchain deployments.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This delicate mix of characteristics to be implemented explains why many Blockchain projects don‚Äôt succeed, despite the rightful claims around the disruptive nature of the technology.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Two frequent mistakes within the Industry:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technology is used as the ultimate technology to solve all the problems described above, and this often leads to failure in the end as Blockchain can‚Äôt fulfill these promises.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technology is used under the false pretext that decentralization is wanted, whereas the real intention is to be in control. Blockchain thinking also requires an entirely different way of thinking than the classical models embedded in the heart of our economies: concentration of power &amp;amp; control and competition need to make room for decentralization and collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains are here to stay!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the hype around blockchain technology and also all the failed initiatives, blockchain technology does allow for digital worlds to exist without centralization.  The information revolution has brought forward a lot of progress and innovation to the people; however, the outcome has also been only a few large organizations controlling all of it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Examples are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online search: Google&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online social: Facebook, Twitter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online banking: any large international bank&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online insurance:  few insurance alliances&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Relationship Management: SalesForce&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Resource Management: Oracle, SAP
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All these organizations are leading in their specific digital innovation sector, and some of them even provide services for free.  Nothing is for free in this world and reality -in return for these services, you accept the terms and conditions which allow the companies to use your personal information and user statistics for their benefits and make money from this behavior derived data. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Most industry leaders have become so powerful that there is almost no way around them anymore. You are practically obliged to comply with their terms and conditions to do something useful with the Internet today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
The world is awakening and seeking alternatives in which such monopolistic structures do not control data and information.  Blockchain technologies allow new solutions to be built without central governing bodies, creating person-to-person sharing and trading opportunities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The combination of people and blockchains is really powerful&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People remain the best to create decentralized business models that combine Blockchain‚Äôs strengths with complementary measures to compensate for the weaknesses of the technology. Blockchains are not replacing people. Blockchain technology is just a tool that enhances people‚Äôs ability to organize themselves around decentralized initiatives that require no central body to govern and control. Therefore, Blockchain is a powerful tool indeed but remains just a tool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A platform for people to start blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there would be a platform where the strong points of blockchains (decentralization) could enable people to organize themselves around a random initiative and launch it based on blockchain technology?  Blockchain As a Service (BAAS).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A platform like that could be powerful to enable people around the world to use and benefit from blockchain technology to organize themselves around digital initiatives, currencies, finance, trade, company, anything. Let‚Äôs consider a small example:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
e.g., Sixty people want to start an organization in which they all have an equal stake.  They can organize this by going to the notary and establishing a company with equity and dividing the equity amongst them. They can run quarterly &#x2F;annual meetings to govern and control the company. They would also need an administration to record decisions and communicate across the organization.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
What if a platform could launch several blockchain nodes (60, one for each of them) and record all decisions, having all information trackable and traceable for anyone? Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) will enable people to organize themselves independently and create new movements, companies, groups, tribes. This would be a powerful platform allowing many people (and hopefully all people) to organize themselves in new ways, free of the need to have notaries, lawyers, and contracts.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
However, to build such a platform, compliance is needed with some pretty specific requirements.  Requirements that enable such a platform not to be governed and controlled by a single organization.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The requirements for such a platform would sum up as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single organization cannot own the platform, it needs to be owned by many&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such a platform cannot have administrator access.  Administrators access takes away the neutrality and privacy that such a platform requires.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be very efficient.  To be available to all people globally, it needs to be affordable for anyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be everywhere.  Part of the efficiency is that it should require expensive international access lines - it needs to be able to live everywhere - in well connected (and affordable) areas as well as in less well-connected places.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Such a platform is a very different platform than most of what we know today.  It needs to be a platform build by many people, for anyone.  It needs not be governed by a single organization; it needs to be governed by many.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
People with the right intentions need to collectively build a platform based on hardware owned by many and software that is open and can be inspected and improved by anyone. It is a platform created by people for people using blockchain technology to achieve a genuinely decentralized nature of the platform running Blockchain as a service.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
People should always remain as the element that brings trust in IT. Blockchains help to register that trust forever.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Organizations should always respect human rights, human effort and human experience. To enable a sustainable and prosperous civilization and world, we need a strong value system.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
*Ideas and texts were inspired from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ind.ie&#x2F;ethical-design&#x2F;. We added our own twist to it.*
&lt;h2 id=&quot;respect-human-rights&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#respect-human-rights&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: respect-human-rights&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Respect Human Rights&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: It is important for a very simple reason: we cannot maintain our quality of life as human beings, the diversity of life on our planet, or Earth‚Äôs ecosystems unless we embrace and protect its balance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equality&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Everyone should have a right to learn, dream, partake and succeed. Equal access also means affordability, not ownership by big greedy companies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralization&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: To better distribute power, value and opportunities, we need more decentralization. Technologies and solutions should be available everywhere to improve equality and sustainability. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openness &amp;amp; Interoperability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Allows technologies to work together in an open way, without limitation, and therefore expands the possibilities for innovation and sharing.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Whatever the location or situation, people should benefit from easy and fast access to information and solutions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;amp; Privacy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Protect people from being put in situations of danger or exploitation. People should be empowered to be independent and they should be the sole owners of their experiences.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;respect-human-effort&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#respect-human-effort&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: respect-human-effort&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Respect Human Effort&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Make sure technologies are reliable and last longer.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplicity&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: We need to keep things simple: no unnecessary complexity - less is more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Let people and companies work together in a 100% transparent way.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: It‚Äôs all about the greater picture. We are stronger together and have to help each other in reaching our common visions.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;respect-human-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#respect-human-experience&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: respect-human-experience&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Respect Human Experience&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ergonomy&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Products and solutions should empower productivity, safety and comfort, while reducing human error.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inclusiveness&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Design should always be global and inclusive. We are all equal.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Products should be visually appealing and should achieve it‚Äôs purpose.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Organisational records and strategies should be accessible to everyone.
