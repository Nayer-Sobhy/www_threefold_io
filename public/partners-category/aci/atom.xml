&lt;p&gt;Building on more than 60 years of classroom experience empowering students to be curious, ask questions, take action, and make a difference in their communities, we are bringing together like-minded educators seeking a different way of teaching and learning. The team at &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.takeactionglobal.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TAG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is committed to creating space for teachers and students to work at local and global levels for the betterment of humanity for today and for tomorrow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to raise the bar of education by having experts to teach the students and by initiating teacher training with help of technology. For years we have been working to bring positive and needed change to the education system and this is another step forward. A peer-to-peer education system opens up the possibilities for learning and positive solutions for our world. Additionally we will be able to set up global projects to tackle climate change and other issues allowing students to connect, brainstorm, create, share, solve problems and take action.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our peer-to-peer platform will run on the ThreeFold Grid and will utilize elements of Digital Twin technology. The Video Chat (Meet) solution will be used to allow teachers to teach refugees. We have already been doing this for five years with Project Kakuma, and thanks to the ThreeFold we will be able to allow people globally to connect and learn from peers, including refugees and others living in harsh conditions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Our vision is to provide a one stop full spectrum art education platform to access, learn and share knowledge in art and culture from across the globe for free. To date, we have compiled 40,000 pieces of art from all around the world into our database, and we aim to become the worldâ€™s largest art and cultural gallery, available to everyone, everywhere.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Art can act as a catalyst to tap into our inner potential as well as our collective intelligence. When going through the history of humanity, it is clear that Art played a major role in shaping the most advanced civilizations of humankind, across eras. Art is a proven tool to inspire faith and elevate cultural growth, while bringing a new perspectives about our reality. Today, studies show that there is a positive correlation between schoolchildrenâ€™s grades in math and literacy, and their involvement with drama or music activities. Also, art brings people together and gives people a chance to be part of a community. Art influences society by changing opinions, instilling values and translating experiences across space and time. Research has shown art affects the fundamental sense of self. Therefore we believe that free global access to art and culture is a prerequisite for a development of human kind.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
