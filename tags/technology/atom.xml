You can also find the recording of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;january-16th-2023-weekly-tech-call-recording&#x2F;3702&quot;&gt;January Community Call&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to catch up on lots of topics around ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;üìÑ Thanks to Mik for summarizing and organizing a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;q-a-from-the-weekly-threefold-tech-and-community-calls&#x2F;3711&quot;&gt;Q&amp;amp;A from the Weekly Threefold Tech and January Community Calls&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, making it easier to find answers to any question addressed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ü©∫ Are you wondering about the self-healing &amp;amp; self-driving capabilities of the Grid? Scott clears out any common misconception in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;self-healing-high-availability-and-the-grid-today&#x2F;3705&quot;&gt;this post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ü¶£ For those who were wondering about the mastodon server being down, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;url?q=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-happened-to-the-threefoldcloud-com-sites&#x2F;3712&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=docs&amp;amp;ust=1674123620068533&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1cWMfcGQJBu_tqJMGlN8ps&quot;&gt;Drew gave us an update&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;! While the server is down, it was not due to a failure of the grid, but rather because it was deployed as a test environment - and the good news is that it was a successful proof-of-concept!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to all of you creating and engaging with content from the forum! Reminder: This is our town hall - you can ask questions, find answers, make proposals, share your opinion and discuss any ThreeFold-related topic. We love seeing it active!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>ThreeFold Today, Tomorrow, &amp; Beyond</title>
		<published>2023-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2023-01-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/today-tomorrow-beyond/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/today-tomorrow-beyond/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the beginning of another year, so I thought it would be a good time to put things into perspective with where we are and where we‚Äôre going.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-today&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-today&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-today&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Today&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs be honest. There is no other project or technology out there like ThreeFold, no one nearly as far along as we are. Our co-founders have decades of experience (and success) in the Internet and Cloud space. They and the team developed a new Internet infrastructure from the ground up, including a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__zos&quot;&gt;stateless operating system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on the Linux kernel, which is quite a significant accomplishment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have the biggest network of decentralized storage, compute, and network on the planet. The technology is in its third generation, functional and ready for utilization, even commercially. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides a sandbox of limitless opportunities for open-source builders ‚Äì developers can (and are) now build(ing) and monetize(ing) projects built on the grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you‚Äôve been following along lately with community calls and all of our updates to see the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;end-of-year-2022-community-call-recording&#x2F;3636&quot;&gt;major progress that was made in 2022&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The technology took major strides, the grid nearly doubled, the community got way more active, and there are some partnerships in the works with huge reach where we can make big impact.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the token price is low and this is less than ideal to say the least, especially for farmers who are running hardware and weary of costs ‚Äì although a power savings feature is coming! But the token is built on strong fundamentals and our efforts are focused on creating a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-new-financial-system-is-needed-for-a-better-future&#x2F;3547&quot;&gt;balanced and sustainable token economy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the long-term.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-tomorrow&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-tomorrow&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-tomorrow&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Tomorrow&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days we‚Äôll be announcing a super exciting project (ThreeFold Grid Services) from the ThreeFold team with the following purpose:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To prove that the current state of the ThreeFold Grid is enough on top of which to start an end-user facing commercial business. We will release a suite of grid services with fiat gateways and we will also create content that explains in steps how to use the technical building blocks to put it all together to create your own solution &#x2F; service.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Q1 we also aim to expose one or several partnerships with the potential to impact millions of people in emerging &#x2F; developing countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have ThreeFold Ventures coming as well, different businesses or arms of ThreeFold including OurPhone that create a holistic ecosystem for a more fair and equal world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there‚Äôs the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-of-internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Regional Internet) model which will come to life this year, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;digital-twin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Digital Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And more ‚Äì this is not comprehensive ‚Äì but you get the picture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-beyond&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-beyond&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-beyond&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Beyond&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is the foundation for people around the world to live in true digital sovereignty, for people who today do not have affordable access to education, communication, and financial tools to gain access. ThreeFold can impact industries from Internet to banking to education to supply chain and more. The possibilities are really limitless, let your imagine run wild. ThreeFold can change the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-future-is-up-to-all-of-us&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#our-future-is-up-to-all-of-us&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: our-future-is-up-to-all-of-us&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Our Future Is up to All of Us&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve said this before, I‚Äôll say it again (and again) ‚Ä¶ A decentralized movement is all about decentralized action and participation. And participation comes in all shapes and sizes. Together, we all need to act and push this into the world. Everyone in this community is empowered to help the project succeed though their own initiatives. The team is of course happy to offer support through technical help and even token grants. ThreeFold will be a success if people continue to choose to believe it is important and dedicate their energy towards it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold can and needs to be a complete, end-to-end decentralized ecosystem empowering all its members to build and create. We have everything we need, and if we don‚Äôt, let‚Äôs solve it. Most importantly, we have each other. Let‚Äôs do this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get involved, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&quot;&gt;forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;two-way chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldfarmers&quot;&gt;farmers chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &#x2F; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;&quot;&gt;manual&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are great places to get started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>How would Decentralisation of the Internet help India?</title>
		<published>2023-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2023-01-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralised-internet-india/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralised-internet-india/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-decentralisation-of-the-internet-help-india&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-would-decentralisation-of-the-internet-help-india&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-would-decentralisation-of-the-internet-help-india&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How would Decentralisation of the Internet help India?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashish Bansal has been a member of the ThreeFold support team since October 2021. He was born in India. Ashish believes that we all deserve a better internet which is free, decentralized and equal for all.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become one of the most important aspects of human life. Our everyday lives are impacted by social media and other online platforms on a very minute level. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and others have become the most convenient way to stay in touch with friends and family. WhiteHart, Udemy and others have made quality education accessible to all. Swiggy, Zomato and others have made our favourite cuisine accessible at home. Amazon, Flipkart and others have grown the shopping experience for Indians with a variety of choices. Netflix, Hotstar, Youtube and others have made entertainment on demand easy for us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, we have all gotten addicted to the comforts that the internet has brought to us, and it wouldn‚Äôt be wrong for us to say that we cannot imagine our lives without the internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Indian internet usage ranks second in the world today behind China, with 43% of its total population online, this also means that there is still a lot of untapped potential in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-with-current-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#issues-with-current-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: issues-with-current-internet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Issues with current Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the internet has helped us in making our lives comfortable, there are several issues with the current Internet services we use. Some of them are mentioned below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#cyber-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: cyber-security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Cyber security&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyber security infrastructure in India today is not well equipped to tackle increasing cyber-crimes. You may not have the resolution to your complaints filed with Cyber Cell Portals on time. Hence there is an increasing number of fraudsters and hackers in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#data-ownership&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: data-ownership&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Data ownership&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal details shared by you on the internet are used by big companies to influence your decision-making process strategically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;higher-cost-to-customers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#higher-cost-to-customers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: higher-cost-to-customers&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Higher cost to customers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since internet infrastructure is owned and controlled by a few big companies, there is an irregular price increase which makes the internet unaffordable to many parts of rural India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralised-internet-is-the-solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralised-internet-is-the-solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralised-internet-is-the-solution&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralised Internet is the solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralisation of the internet refers to the arrangement of the internet or its components such that no single entity or organization has control or authority over the network. It  holds the potential to revolutionize the way every nation accesses and utilizes the world wide web. India, one of the biggest players in the digital world, can greatly benefit from Internet decentralization. It would open up many new opportunities for both the country and its citizens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, decentralization of the internet would give India more control over its digital landscape. Instead of relying on a single, centralized entity to power its network, India could decentralize its internet and make the administration of the network much more efficient. With this additional control and efficiency, India could develop a more secure and reliable infrastructure, while also controlling the delivery of services. This could lead to faster, more reliable connection speeds, along with increased safety and security.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, decentralization of the internet would allow India to establish itself as a technological leader. By decentralizing the internet, India could shift its focus from the existing internet infrastructure to developing innovative technology and applications. This could include the development of decentralized artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and much more. Potential applications of these technologies could drastically improve the education, healthcare, and transportation sectors of India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, decentralization of the internet could help with digital media access and distribution. This could open up new opportunities for providing access to digital media in rural areas, allowing for more effective access to education and entertainment. Furthermore, it could also provide access to more reliable payment services, as well as better consumer protection policies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, decentralization of the internet holds the potential to greatly benefit India and its citizens. It would give India control over its internet infrastructure, opening the door for development of innovative technologies and applications. Additionally, it could provide more effective access to digital media, along with more reliable payment services and consumer protection policies. In order for India to take full advantage of the potential of decentralization of the internet, it must take decisive steps towards implementing the necessary reforms and investments to ensure its success.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-threefold-can-contribute&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-threefold-can-contribute&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-threefold-can-contribute&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How ThreeFold can contribute&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold technology runs on the concept of a grid formed by farmers who are independent people, unlike big corporations, that connect their nodes anywhere network and electricity is present to create a global distributed internet infrastructure. This resolves the problem of monopoly and price of big internet companies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology also ensures that you get data security which was how the internet was originally intended to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year marked by significant steps on technology, big strides towards decentralization, a commitment to our values (planet, people, and authenticity), time well-spent on the ground, and strong contributions from the community. Let‚Äôs take a look back at all that ThreeFold held space for this year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-grid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grid has grown significantly this year, with a whopping total of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;grid-stats-new-nodes-utilization-overview&#x2F;3291&#x2F;33&quot;&gt;2900+ online nodes as of this week&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The farming community is contributing capacity across 62 countries, made up of nearly 72,000 Cores and providing nearly 40PB of storage capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, we officially said goodbye to Grid v2, which was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;discontinuation-grid-v2&#x2F;3385&quot;&gt;discontinued&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, along with all platforms no longer needed on v3. Farewell old friend!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to our motivated team and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldtesting&quot;&gt;testing community&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the grid evolved from version 3.0 to 3.7.1, and soon &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tf-product-updates-december-2022-tfgrid-v3-8-0-updates&#x2F;3654&quot;&gt;3.8&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Each update included improvements to various ThreeFold Grid components including the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Zero-OS, TF Wallet, TF Chain and more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of our farmers for upholding &amp;amp; expanding the Grid! It was beautiful to see the community growth and engagement on both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldfarmers&quot;&gt;chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;farming&#x2F;42&quot;&gt;the forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;power-saving-feature-in-development-for-farmers&#x2F;3399&quot;&gt;power saving feature&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is in development for farmers, allowing idle nodes to power off and still farm tokens. Our developers worked very hard to make it manageable from the chain. While they got it to work recently, the solution was not the most ideal one, therefore, the team is rethinking this feature as a service that a farmer can choose to run for their farm rather than something that happens entirely on TF Chain. Stay updated &amp;amp; contribute to this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;home&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1371&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Full Virtual Machines, introduced in Q4, allow limitless possibilities and are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;full-vms-now-live-on-mainnet-playground&#x2F;3449&quot;&gt;easier than ever to deploy on the Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as from Grid 3.7.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grid experience became much more simple. For instance, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-threefold-dashboard-dive-in-the-new-internet&#x2F;3635&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has been improved &amp;amp; features such as the explorer have been integrated within.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are very proud to have launched the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru&#x2F;3299&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twi&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (formerly Uhuru), a decentralized alternative to digital platforms, tools and browsers, offering a tangible UX. Anyone can try it out &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.freeflow.life&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is at the core of ThreeFold and creates resilience while involving the community in the decision-making process, leading to wider ownership and greater engagement. In 2022, we took great steps towards true decentralization, and will continue to take this path next year!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Grid Enhancement Proposals were made and voted on by the community around the grid and farming.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, we officially introduced the validator program, which will come to fruition in 2023.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-updates-july-2022-tfgrid-v3-6-1-highlights-more&#x2F;3206&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid v3.6.1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the DAO functionality has been live on TF Chain.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the token price has been low this year, it presents a great opportunity for believers to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_ecosystem&quot;&gt;buy TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, it became possible to buy TFT directly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;get-tft-directly-with-btc&#x2F;1825&quot;&gt;with BTC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Bitcoin) as well as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tft-fiat-gateway-beta-testing-program&#x2F;2746&quot;&gt;with fiat currencies through the Mercuryo gateway&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, we‚Äôll be introducing TFT-fiat gateways into the Mastodon weblet (see below) and across the whole grid ecosystem to make it even easier to use grid services.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers in truly decentralized models, we have repeatedly questioned how to exist without centralized exchanges. In August, TFT was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tft-will-be-delisted-on-liquid-what-now-and-what-next&#x2F;3197&quot;&gt;delisted from the Liquid Exchange&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the result of their acquisition by FTX earlier this year. A blessing in disguise, after seeing the monumental &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;on-the-ftx-crash-and-the-tft-model&#x2F;3524&quot;&gt;FTX crash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which affected Liquid (which could have resulted in a loss of funds, although the exchange Liquid ‚Äúhopes to return customer funds in 2023‚Äù) and sent ripple effects across the entire industry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our aim next year will be to introduce concepts like the liquidity pool and P2P DeFi wallet to provide a resilient, sustainable, and native &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-new-financial-system-is-needed-for-a-better-future&#x2F;3547&quot;&gt;financial system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the Internet of Internets, which strengthens the foundation of the ecosystem by enhancing the stability and liquidity of the ThreeFold Token.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;partnerships&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#partnerships&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: partnerships&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Partnerships&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We doubled down on commitment to follow our values, particularly when it comes to collaborations and partnerships.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold signed a Head of Terms in December 2022 to officialize a public-private-partnership with a country in East Africa in Q1 2023. This partnership will support the roll out of a decentralized Internet infrastructure to support fintech services, e-residency and more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold is on track to support international communities to launch their digital nations (AKA network states).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Alongside 27 organizations such as Atos and Deutsche Telekom, ThreeFold is part of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gaia-x.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;structura-x-lighthouse-project-european-cloud-infrastructure-launched-concrete-implementation&quot;&gt;Structura-X&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì a lighthouse project ensuring common European infrastructure services that meet &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gaia-x.eu&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Gaia-X&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; requirements.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fast-moving and ever-changing world, it is our belief that ThreeFold is one of the few projects out there that can genuinely enable a better future. We are driven by our mission and vision, guided by our values, and upheld by our global community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 will be about continuing to improve the technology and simplify the grid experience, bringing to life the Regional Internets and Digital Twin concepts, introducing partnerships we‚Äôve been alluding to this year, and furthering the decentralization of ThreeFold by empowering the community to take action independently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is all of ours, and as a decentralized movement, we all share the responsibility to drive this project forward in meaningful ways to the best of our own abilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is the future. Based on decentralization and open source paradigms, we are a strong movement that continues to grow resilience. We are hungry for a better tomorrow, and ready to continue the journey towards the actualization of our common vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs to 2022!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we come, 2023!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Twitter, Mastodon, and Why We‚Äôre Evolving the Internet</title>

		<updated>2022-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/twitter-mastodon/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/twitter-mastodon/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;twitter-mastodon-and-why-we-re-evolving-the-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#twitter-mastodon-and-why-we-re-evolving-the-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: twitter-mastodon-and-why-we-re-evolving-the-internet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Twitter, Mastodon, and Why We‚Äôre Evolving the Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Elon Musk‚Äôs acquisition of Twitter becoming official at the end of October, many people have become uncomfortable with the idea of a single controversial billionaire with a lot on his plate having that level of power over a platform used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide ‚Äì making decisions that look to be putting the company, the platform, and its users in jeopardy, at least in the short term.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the acquisition and a series of events thereafter, millions of Twitter users have started looking for a replacement, with more than one million people flocking to the leading decentralized Twitter alternative, Mastodon, over the past two weeks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;mastodon_users.png&quot; alt=&quot;mastodon_users&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time we‚Äôve seen the alarm bells ring, a mass exodus from a top social networking site or communication platform. (And by the way, it won‚Äôt be the last.) As an example, last year after WhatsApp announced some changes to its terms of service, tens of millions of new accounts were created on Signal and Telegram. And earlier this year, Facebook reported a loss in daily active users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that most platforms are owned &amp;amp; controlled by the few. And it actually goes further than just platforms: the way the infrastructure of the current internet model is built, its foundational layers, are controlled by the few as well. Think about it, as ‚Äòusers‚Äô of platforms, browsers, websites, etc., we have become the product, or rather, our data has become the product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted advertising, cookies, geo-localisation. Agenda setting might have been ignited in the newspaper industry hundreds of years ago, but it definitely reached the Internet. When you search for something on the web, through most browsers &amp;amp; platforms, the outcomes you get are the result of an agenda setting. This means that a few decide which information is more important than the other. Often, this decision is subjective, and influenced by the highest bids to get on top of the list.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs happening with Twitter is just the latest warning of the dangers of the centralized Internet, and the fact that people are leaving is the latest signal that the world is increasingly ready for a decentralized digital world. People aren‚Äôt just boycotting social media, they are leaving to go somewhere else considered ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. They are migrating to Mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What makes Mastodon a viable alternative to Twitter?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon has a lot of the same functionalities as Twitter, such as replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hash tags. However, it is not owned or operated by any one organization. Instead, it‚Äôs made up of lots of different servers (also called ‚Äúinstances‚Äù), all talking to one another. The service describes itself as a ‚Äúfederated network which operates in a similar way to email.‚Äù And as it is open source, Mastodon allows for anyone to download, modify, &amp;amp; install Mastodon on their own servers. Pretty nifty, right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;mastodon.png&quot; alt=&quot;mastodon&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon was created in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike most popular social media sites, like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, Mastodon is a nonprofit. As such, its goal is to benefit the public rather than shareholders. Twitter has built up a reputation for being the ‚Äúwatercooler of the world‚Äù. While it would be quite a task for Mastodon to replicate that feat at scale, many people might prefer the latter for a number of reasons, like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over your timeline: No algorithm dictating what you‚Äôll see ‚Äì and no advertisements&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for Sale: ‚ÄúWe will never serve ads or push profiles for you to see. That means your data and your time are yours and yours alone.‚Äù - Mastodon&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of moderation: Individual communities may create their own content guidelines, offering a variety of different user experiences. Join a server with the rules you agree with, or host your own!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization: Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, able to interoperate with others to form one global social network. Anybody can deploy Mastodon on their own infrastructure, under no third-party control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source: Mastodon believes in the right to use, copy, study and change Mastodon as one sees fit, since everyone benefits from contributions from the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interoperable: Built on open web protocols, Mastodon can speak with any other platform that implements ActivityPub. With one account, users get access to a whole universe of social apps‚Äîthe Fediverse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is happening with Twitter is a reflection of the entire Internet model. Now, more and more people are opening their eyes to the shared fundamentals of decentralization and open source, which are paradigms shared by ThreeFold &amp;amp; Mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where centralization is the default way of operating, we tend to be relatively oblivious to what it entails. Being part of a centralized Internet ultimately makes us dependent on the relative few that dictate our digital lives. By moving away, through decentralization, we can take control of our digital lives again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;twitter_vs_internet.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter_vs_internet&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon and the whole Fediverse have already attracted incredible communities with similar values and mindsets as that of ThreeFold and our community. Everyone joining Mastodon is looking for decentralization ‚Äì whether they know it or not. Really, this mass exodus from Twitter is more proof (a la people leaving Facebook in droves or moving from WhatsApp to other messaging tools) that the world is increasingly ready for decentralization and what ThreeFold enables.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Twitter for Mastodon is a step in the right direction, but if you are really alarmed by what has been happening with this Twitter saga, we are here to invite you to take action and be a part of a better Internet system. We can build this together!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-threefold-support-mastodon&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-can-threefold-support-mastodon&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-can-threefold-support-mastodon&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How can ThreeFold support Mastodon?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold provides a reliable decentralized infrastructure that Mastodon and the rest of the platforms within the Fediverse need, and we believe that those communities will be very interested in our broader vision as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Movement is collectively building an Internet by the people for the people, from the infrastructure level up to the experiences. You can plug in hardware, join the ThreeFold Grid, and provide decentralized Internet capacity for the communities around you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ThreeFold offers three main solutions to the growing Mastodon community:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: ThreeFold is making it very easy for anyone and everyone to create their own server through the ThreeFold Playground, so they are in full control. And it‚Äôs on decentralized infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True Co-Ownership&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: We‚Äôll make it possible to co-own communities via smart contract, so if some nodes leave or go offline, the server is still viable. So any group of people can chip in some money and co-own your own Mastodon server. By creating your own community, as of Grid 3.8, you will also be able to ask people for contributions in order to operate the server, etc. And you can set and maintain your own moderation standards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Flexible (Secure) Login&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Lastly, we‚Äôre going to focus on authentication. Today it‚Äôs only email based, which means it‚Äôs easy for people to hide. ThreeFold could enable different verification options ‚Äì email-based, TF Connect, and even TF Connect + KYC. So each server can have their own standards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is ThreeFold already doing to make this happen?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the team is working on an easy-to-deploy weblet so that anybody can easily launch their own instance of Mastodon running on top of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a plan for people to be able to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-to-deploy-mastadon-on-the-threefold-grid-today&#x2F;3487&quot;&gt;deploy their own Mastodon servers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a website re: Mastodon + ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached out to the Mastodon team (We have done this officially, but we can do more of it from more angles).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating plenty of content on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;threefold-grid-utilization&#x2F;fediverse&#x2F;113&quot;&gt;forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (e.g. open letter to Mastodon community), posting on social media, finding and engaging with public conversations about Mastodon on Twitter (something we can all do).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held a Community Call around Mastodon &amp;amp; the Fediverse to discuss in further details what has been mentioned in this blog.

The team found so much value within it that we felt it was important to give it a permanent space within the ThreeFold Blogs collection, and Drew agreed to this.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow decentralization lovers, I am in search of people looking to contribute to what is now the largest decentralized network in the world, working towards the goal of providing a decentralized internet that breaks down barriers to information and compute resource access. Our network provides digital equality to all users while placing the control of their data back into their hands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I‚Äôm discussing is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Threefold.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this is a project that currently has nearly 3000 Bare-Metal** **nodes in 64 countries allowing anyone in the world to deploy an industry standard VPS on the decentralized infrastructure with no involvement of the centralized cloud providers, This is a network meant to be used by everyone that can be expanded by anyone. You can check out a current map of the nodes online on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.grid.tf&#x2F;explorer&#x2F;statistics&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Explorer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid consists of three synergistic layers: The Nodes, The Network, and the BlockChain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nodes:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; These are hardware that gives its grid its power, The requirements for running a 3Node are a bare metal x86_64 machine and a reliable internet connection. These nodes can be hosted in a variety of environments spanning at home deployments to rented-space DC‚Äôs. This includes DC‚Äôs themselves being able to bring capacity online so long as it‚Äôs a fully bare metal device.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;plug and play solutions&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for bringing a 3Node online on the [3Node marketplace](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.3node.global&#x2F;index.php?dispatch= categories.view&amp;amp;category_id=167), this marketplace includes node offerings from both the organizations itself as well as multiple independent businesses that have become certified 3Node Resellers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre familiar with the concepts of building a server&#x2F;pc you can also bring your hardware online as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;D.I.Y 3Node&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; this allows you to contribute any additional hardware you may have in your deployment to the support of both the grids network and compute capacity. you can find documentation on D.I.Y nodes on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;diy-nodes-guide&#x2F;837&quot;&gt;Forums&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or in the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__diy_guide&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each node is booted using a fully in house developed autonomous operating system that automates both node deployment and workloads being deployed on the node after its online, called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;zos&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This OS is a hypervisor environment that accepts commands from and is managed by the block-chain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Network(s):&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The grid is supported by multiple internal and external networks that allow for the nodes to function as a decentralized data center. This is made of two major components.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z-Net&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;- is an internal private overlay network between VMs, Kubernetes Nodes, Containers and the grid. This network allows for minimal usage of Public ipv4 space while still allowing for global deployment solutions encompassing multiple 3Nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planetary Network-&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; This is a peer to peer end to encrypted network solution based on opensource technologies (yggdrasil) that allow grid users to create, develop and overlay networks designed to protect users ability to communicate and access information. You can find the github Repo &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;planetary_network&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, with 3000 endpoints all controlled by a single DAO, the potential exists to create the most reliable peer to peer mesh in existence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public IPv4-&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Threefold farmers have the ability to add Public Ipv4 to the grid in addition to their compute capacity, these IPs can be deployed as gateway addresses in support of the grid, or rented by end users for their workloads, at the time of this writing the threefold grid has 1114 Public Ipv4 addresses available for use. you can find documentation on adding I.P addresses to the grid &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;diy-public-node-guide&#x2F;3340&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BlockChain:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; the blockchain technologies built into the Threefold Grid represent what makes the grid truly unique and allows it to be utilized to support customer facing workloads or provide a decentralized compute resource pool. grid utilization is supported and created through two avenues&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage workloads can be deployed using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;terraform-provider-grid&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with offerings of HDD, SSD and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;terraform-provider-grid&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File Storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Providers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: these are developers of user facing services that utilize the grid as their hosting platform. These organizations&#x2F;individuals are able to develop customized solutions that provide needed services in their market and receive rewards for the utilization that their developments bring. A great example of this is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zonaris.con&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zonaris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is a third party organization that is quickly taking the lead in grid solution development. They have recently released an interface that allows end users to deploy &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamr.network&#x2F;discover&#x2F;network&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Streamr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nodes on the Threefold grid while paying in fiat currency. you can get started with them at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.zonaris.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Get Zonaris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows developers to invest in only their code while having the infrastructure of a worldwide virtual data center at their disposal to scale their solutions with their business needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution providers are able to automate their tools being deployed on the grid using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;terraform-provider-grid&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this has all truly come together to form is an organization where anyone can contribute to building a more private and secure internet that is designed to allow universal access to information and compute power regardless of the end user‚Äôs nationality or beliefs. Threefold truly exists to capitalize on the ideal economies from every corner of the world, in order to provide a better digital future for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can You Do?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what you see today at Threefold.io is the work of 100s of decentralized contributors working together towards a common goal. The grid is designed so that anyone can contribute whether you‚Äôre a developer, a property owner, an I.S.P, or just someone with a spare computer and a network connection. As it stands the grid is strong and well supported across the world. The biggest impact that can be made today is by developing solutions that leverage the grid and use its resources to bring affordable and accessible hosting to end users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many discussions happening on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&quot;&gt;Threefold Forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about partnerships with other projects and how we can better support both the crypto landscape and the general internet user base. Even by just joining discussions on the Threefold Forum and providing your input and ideas you can help to make sure that the internet of tomorrow is built for and by the users of tomorrow. but there are lots of ways to contribute:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Technology as a Tool for Humanity</title>

		<updated>2022-10-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-as-a-tool-for-humanity/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-as-a-tool-for-humanity/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-as-a-tool-for-humanity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#technology-as-a-tool-for-humanity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: technology-as-a-tool-for-humanity&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Technology as a tool for humanity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology‚Ä¶ In today‚Äôs world, technology holds a central role. Younger generations in developed countries grow up amidst technological wonders of all sorts, truly immersed in an evolving digital landscape. Any information is a click away, offering immense intellectual capital unlike ever before ‚Äì and on the other hand, great distraction, misinformation, and potential for division.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is a word dating back to the early 17th century, formed from the Greek &lt;em&gt;tekhnologia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; meaning ‚Äòsystematic treatment,‚Äô itself formed from &lt;em&gt;tekhnƒì&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; meaning ‚Äòart, craft.‚Äô Technology is the application of knowledge to reach practical goals in a specifiable and reproducible way. The word technology may also mean the product of such an endeavor, as it is mostly used today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technologies enter our world they either add on incrementally to already existing technologies (i.e., tablets) or shake everything up (i.e., television). Technology can be found in most industries and at different levels, ranging from vehicles to home appliances, passing through healthcare, education, and even entertainment. Sometimes technology replaces human labor by replicating it, other times it facilitates processes and makes labor less intensive. Some technology even surpasses human precision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technology has had an important role in the creation of today‚Äôs societies, it might have an even greater role for our future. Two opposite pictures could be painted: a utopia or a dystopia. The utopia of a world full of values-driven, well-constructed technologies promises an increased quality of life for all, with digital tools which, for instance, could provide or enable equal educational opportunities for all, mobility everywhere, a universal basic income and the promise of never having to work again (e.g. in the sense of wage labor).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a dystopia could be the result of reckless technological advancement. Questions are raised, like, will most jobs be dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) in 20 years? Will privacy become a myth, with personal data being controlled by a handful? Will consumerism rule societies and reinforce social struggles?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One technology that has been slowly taking the dystopian route is the Internet. While major Internet and Cloud infrastructure advancements were made since the beginning of the millennium through hyper-scale data centers, the current Internet infrastructure model has many flaws:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is centralized&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute, storage and network infrastructures. Also the global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is inefficient&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Most of the data centers are located in the U.S, forcing the rest of the world to connect via Internet sea cables and having their data flowing outside of their borders and back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not scalable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Emerging technologies require the global Internet infrastructure to triple in size in the next 4 years. It took 20+ years to build the current Internet infrastructure. So, we need to build 3 times more in 5 times less time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not affordable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyper-scale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not private&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Anyone can access Google Chrome or Facebook for free. But as outlined by movies such as the Social Dilemma or The Great Hack, if it is free, you are the product. The web‚Äôs Ad model is threatening our privacy and the net neutrality of the global internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not secure&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The current IT stack depends on human error and it has been considered as the major cause of cybersecurity breaches with more than 95% of the cases. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not sustainable:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage and consuming around 205 TWh - More than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It cannot support future demand:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will be needed to build and consume an additional 400 GW&#x2F;h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan‚Äôs energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ThreeFold, we want to encourage the creation of a utopian future driven by thoughtful technology. Our founders took part in the way the Internet was created, full of beautiful promises, and have seen first-hand how those promises have been corrupted throughout its evolution. By building a new Internet infrastructure from scratch, ThreeFold goes back to those original promises while having learnt from the development mistakes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristof, our CEO, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@despiegk&#x2F;once-upon-a-time-only-30-years-ago-an-experiment-started-called-the-internet-5251e0da6a76&quot;&gt;wrote in a blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Internet allows the expansion of our village life to become a global community. It allows us to act as a global tribe with all information at our fingertips, it offers the possibility to get equal access to all planet resources. It has the promise for global free communication, instant availability of information, unlimited opportunities for growth and education. But what happened to our Beautiful Internet?‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Internet allowed us to become more efficient in depriving mother earth from her resources. It allowed us to become more addicted to immediate gratification, examples are social media networks and the adult entertainment industry. Beautiful new possibilities like digital currencies became a gambling game and a source of wealth for the smartest hackers. The communication capabilities of the Internet allowed the few to manipulate the many.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting people, planet and authenticity at the core of the development of our technology, we want to gift societes a remade internet. Features of this technology include sovereignty &amp;amp; decentralization, security &amp;amp; privacy, unlimited scalability, green &amp;amp; self healing properties, cost effectiveness, and reliability. The human is put at the center of our Internet model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology should not be a tool to extort humanity, but one at the service of humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>What is a Digital Twin?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-digital-twin&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-a-digital-twin&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-a-digital-twin&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is a Digital Twin?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current Internet system, each of us exists many times, each application provider owns &lt;em&gt;our&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; data while offering functionality &lt;em&gt;they&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; own. We become the user. We become the product. Instead, what if we were at the center of our digital lives?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web4 Digital Twin architecture does just that: it puts us at the center of our digital experience. Indeed, Digital Twin is a user-centric technological platform to build efficient, sovereign and secure digital experiences. Digital Twin technology empowers people and businesses to exchange information and value without any intermediaries, while making applications more scalable, efficient and secure than on any other web paradigm such as Web2, Web3 or Web5. Digital Twins require a decentralized Internet infrastructure and run perfectly on top of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Your Digital Twin is a mirror of yourself!&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Digital Twin runs on a location of your choice, which becomes your personal Internet Gateway. Each Twin is owned by only one owner, who in the end is more like the human mirror to the Twin. The Twin has lots of capabilities and is available for its ‚Äúhuman mirror‚Äù 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin. A Twin owns your data and your identity, all stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. Thus, you own your data, your identity and your digital skills for all your life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-digital-twin-has-capabilities&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#your-digital-twin-has-capabilities&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: your-digital-twin-has-capabilities&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Your Digital Twin has Capabilities&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twins are powerful and have many capabilities which are used when they enter an experience. Here are the capabilities of the Digital Twin:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your creations to the rest of the world&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote your products and services&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your knowledge and help others to grow&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover and Learn
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find information, alternative indexing engine (neutral)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know what is truthful and what is not (proof of authenticity)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn and become smarter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage my digital wealth (digital currencies)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange anything for anything else (money for tokens, services, products)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy&#x2F;Sell goods and services&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I collaborate on documents, images, videos, code, ‚Ä¶&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I manage a project, plan events, define deadlines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your agenda and time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize your digital content so you can find it back, and it‚Äôs nicely organized&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your circles (groups of people)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that only the right people have access to your digital assets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if you die, make sure your loved ones can inherit your digital assets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your digital life is secure (give access to your assets to your circles)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give proof of authenticity to assets and information from others&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and Expand
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code and extend the Twin (improve Twin capabilities for yourself and others)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your own experiences&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twin has basic capabilities listed above which are strongly version controlled, but contributions from the global community are more than welcomed. The idea is to create a system which is simply good enough for any possible experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;your_digital_twin.png&quot; alt=&quot;Your Digital Twin&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very different paradigm compared to current web or mobile applications where capabilities are owned by the provider of the application. Besides, rather than survival of the fittest, we believe in a system of collaboration, where we invite everyone to make the system better so it fits us all. We don‚Äôt need three chat systems, we need one which is usable by thousands of experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can create experiences re-using the open source capabilities the Twin offers, also eliminating the need to reinvent features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-on-connection-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#note-on-connection-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: note-on-connection-security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Note on Connection &amp;amp; Security&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a ‚Äúuser‚Äù, you can use any browser to access experiences built on top of your Digital Twin. For example, a storage experience that stores data on your Twin or a browser experience that allows you to surf the web from your Twin‚Äôs node. When you connect to your Twin, our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;web4&#x2F;threefold__threefold_connect&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Connect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; makes sure that the connection is secure. The Twin runs on a node on the ThreeFold Grid, which you are securely connected to. This takes care of a very safe approach and unlimited scalability. We will dive deeper into the Twin‚Äôs security and scalability aspects in a future blog!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-twin-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#digital-twin-in-a-nutshell&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: digital-twin-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Digital Twin in a nutshell&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by now you will have a better understanding of the Digital Twin concept. Here is a short recap of everything mentioned so far about it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have full control over your own digital life.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiences can be created using standard web &amp;amp; native technologies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Digital Twin delivers the web interface to your (secure) browser.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need for information to travel to central data centers, all communication is fast and private between Digital Twins: No more client-server.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All logic of your digital life is 100% private to you running in your Twin.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is super efficient and sustainable, +10x power savings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No blockchain required for your digital life = more privacy, performance, green
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception: blockchain is needed for digital currencies and as a phone book for Digital Twin‚Äôs identity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

		<title>An Open Invitation for Testing</title>
		<published>2022-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/open-invitation-for-testing/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold technology, ecosystem and community have the potential to kickstart a new Internet era filled with abundance and opportunities for all. ThreeFold is 100% open-source, so anyone can contribute to ThreeFold on GitHub and build their own solutions and applications on ThreeFold‚Äôs infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now‚Äôs the time to start utilizing what we‚Äôve built together and to start deploying the solutions and experiences we want to see in this world. Now‚Äôs the time to build better alternatives for people, enterprises and governments on top of this foundational infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you all to come in, see what‚Äôs possible, and start building ‚Äì today!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-testing-so-crucial&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-is-testing-so-crucial&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-is-testing-so-crucial&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why is testing so crucial?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold created an open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure that offers a place for developers, end-users and everyone in-between to collectively build an open digital world with full digital sovereignty. We seek to re-imagine business, governance, finance, education and more to build a better future for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This future can only be achieved with the collaboration of a strong, healthy and dedicated community. One of the key challenges for a project like ours is the continuous testing and improving of new features as well as building all of the applications and solutions we‚Äôd like to see to enhance and grow the ecosystem. Community contributions are the heart and a crucial driver of the growing ThreeFold movement ‚Äì a global movement that is open and decentralized, meaning it is up to each and everyone of us to push things forward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter your experience level, from developers to end-users and everyone in-between, there are options for you to contribute to ThreeFold. Whether you‚Äôre more tech-savvy and would like to develop solutions on top of the Grid and test tech features or rather help us improve the manuals and spread the word, there are many ways to take action and support the movement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable, open-source peer-to-peer infrastructure together with a growing community of enthusiastic, driven developers and end-users are the key to accelerating the growth and development of the Grid and to unlocking all of its potential. And the more people believe in ThreeFold and our Internet of Internets vision, the sooner we can bring digital sovereignty, empowerment and meaningful experiences to the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why should you join ThreeFold‚Äôs tester community?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why get involved in ThreeFold? Well first of all, you can join an engaged, open movement that seeks to shape the future we want to live in and provide better solutions for our planet and people. You can meet, exchange and collaborate with people from all over the world that share similar interests and values.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also learn new skills and get to know some innovative technology that enables you to build and test pretty cool applications and solutions ‚Äì like deploying a Subsquid instance on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or checking out the different decentralized alternatives to solutions we use every day like WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome or Zoom with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.freeflow.life&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Our open, friendly and skilled community can offer you support and advice as you start testing and building. Let‚Äôs help each other and build cool stuff together!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Community ‚Äì Where ideas come to life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about what fellow community members are building on ThreeFold? Here are a few recent examples:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teisie has been working on a few great tools to make things easier for his fellow ThreeFolders like an iOS app for node monitoring and a geo explorer. Moreover, he‚Äôs been working on an uptime tool and deployment calculator ‚Äì hosted on the Grid and using Drew‚Äôs gateway node for public access. Learn more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;teisies-uptime-tool-and-deployment-calculator&#x2F;3384?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Well done, Teisie!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another skilled community member building on the Grid is Drew. With his &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;cockpit-managed-ubuntu-vm&#x2F;3376?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;community project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a Cockpit management interface, he provides a web-based interface for managing a VM that allows users to do a lot of maintenance tasks without ssh ‚Äì even including full remote desktop capabilities from the browser. Pretty cool, right?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for? Start exploring and using the many solutions on the ThreeFold Grid today ‚Äì whether by deploying a weblet, testing the FreeFlow Twin or simply joining our testing group!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

While &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, gives you a comprehensive overview of the Grid, its evolution and capabilities, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure-part-two&#x2F;&quot;&gt;second part&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is focused on the low-level building blocks and particularly interesting for the more tech-savvy crowd.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third and final part of our series on ThreeFold‚Äôs game-changing Internet infrastructure and the solutions available today. This time, we‚Äôll show you what‚Äôs possible on the ThreeFold Playground today and how you can become one of the first testers of digitally sovereign end-user experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an incredible opportunity to become early adopters of our unique solutions, to get a taste of what it means to become digitally sovereign, and to help shape the future of the Internet. Together we build a decentralized digital world!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes it quite easy to build on top of the ThreeFold Grid by deploying weblets. A &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__weblets_home?id=weblets&quot;&gt;weblet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a compiled JavaScript component which can be embedded in any site. With ThreeFold, it basically establishes a private environment running inside your browser, and allows you to share it ‚Äì while you maintain full control of all activities happening there by using your private key, and with full decentralization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the TF Playground, a variety of applications are made available and deployable within just a few clicks, all on top of a fully decentralized peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. From Virtual Machines to Kubernetes to Presearch Nodes, CapRover, ownCloud, and more ‚Äì the playground allows you to build in a truly decentralized environment. Essentially, the Playground is an ever-expanding ecosystem of easily-deployable weblets that are built for a decentralized future. It‚Äôs the fastest way to build, test, and deploy and enables pretty much anyone to build and experiment with deployment on the Grid. So, this is huge!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Visit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the TF Playground to explore the possibilities and read this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-focus-series-tf-playground-v3-7-0&#x2F;3315?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to find out what the new version 3.7.0 of the Playground ‚Äì now live on testnet ‚Äì has to offer.

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of the weblets available on the Playground:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presearch is a longstanding partner of ThreeFold and one of the most popular solutions offered on the Grid. As of the Grid v3.6 release, any 3Node can now host a Presearch node ‚Äì so if you‚Äôre a ThreeFold farmer, it‚Äôs now become quite easy for you to host Presearch on your own node. Simply follow &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;presearch-nodes&#x2F;3250?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;this deployment guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to get decentralized search on top of a truly decentralized infrastructure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Basically, you can think of Subsquid as an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool, with a GraphQL server included. With Grid v3.7.0 live on testnet, you can now pre-process and decode raw chain data and store it for easier access by the query nodes by deploying your own Subsquid instance on the Grid‚Äôs testnet within just a few clicks &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.test.grid.tf&#x2F;#&#x2F;subsquid&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the ThreeFold Playground, ThreeFold is building a vast ecosystem of advanced deployment experiences and opening up a world of possibilities ‚Äì allowing anyone to build, test and deploy easily and within a few clicks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve entered the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four-phases-of-threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;third phase of our journey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; towards our ultimate vision of a better future ‚Äì the phase of Web 4. In addition to fully comprehensive decentralized edge cloud solutions, the ThreeFold ecosystem is also developing a range of applications and experiences across IoT, metaverse, blockchain, DeFi, banking, education and beyond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this phase ‚Äì which has only just begun ‚Äì a multitude of valuable and meaningful experiences are being built by the ThreeFold ecosystem and partners to empower people with equal chances to learn, create, and thrive in a decentralized digital economy ‚Äì what we like to call an abundance-based future for humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first roll-out of the third phase will empower people to become fully self-sovereign thanks to ThreeFold‚Äôs Digital Twin technology and a variety of decentralized alternatives to popular applications and tools.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Twin technology provides each user with a unique digital identity that can serve as the key to an open, self-sovereign and complete digital future. This solution was designed with a very simple objective in mind: everyone should be the center of their entire digital life. It represents your digital self and hosts your entire digital life in a secure and private way ‚Äì empowering you to own your data and offering you decentralized applications that enable you to maintain your sovereignty. For end users, owning their own deployments opens the possibility for a full range of experiences that have the same quality as crypto ‚Äì self custody.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Grid V3.7.0, ThreeFold‚Äôs all-in-one decentralized productivity tool that includes instant messaging, video call, social, and data storage features ‚Äì formerly known as Uhuru ‚Äì is being rebranded to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru&#x2F;3299?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It brings sovereign and secure alternatives to many of the centralized solutions we use every day like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome, Zoom and many more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs reliable, open-source, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure together with a growing community of enthusiastic, driven early-adopter developers and end-users are the key to accelerating the growth and development of the Grid and to unlocking all of its potential. While the foundation has been laid, it will be up to all of us as a movement to improve and build upon it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking back at the ThreeFold Grid‚Äôs evolution and what makes it a game-changing Internet infrastructure in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it‚Äôs time to explore our cloud solution and the technology available today in part two! You can think of these as some of the essential low-level building blocks that when combined created a limitless sandbox for developers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre wondering what virtual machines are, haven‚Äôt heard about Kubernetes before and don‚Äôt know your way around coding languages, this part might be less interesting for you. Feel free to skip and jump right into &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure-part-three&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part three&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on weblets and end-user experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Elements of our comprehensive &amp;amp; decentralized cloud solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid provides &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_primitives&quot;&gt;various primitives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for compute, storage, and network ‚Äì fulfilling all the needs centralized cloud providers cater to as well, while offering advantages in terms of decentralization, energy efficiency, security and more. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; includes a collection of components, called primitives. These primitives are the low-level constructs which can be deployed on the ThreeFold Grid. As mentioned above, they act as building blocks for skilled developers that enable them to build and create in complete digital freedom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the high compatibility of ThreeFold‚Äôs primitives with industry-standard tools and protocols makes it easy and seamless for developers to migrate workloads to the Grid. All of the primitives not only benefit from the unique efficiency and security features of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but also come with unique features and capabilities themselves. Here are some of the primitives to give you an idea of what you‚Äôll get:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;zmachine?id=zmachine&quot;&gt;ZMachine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a lightweight virtual machine (VM) solution that‚Äôs unique to the ThreeFold Grid. ZMachine enables both traditional VM deployments and also introduces a next generation container specification built on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos_fs?id=why-this-zflist-concept&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; technology. ZFlist containers enabled by ZMachines are more secure and more flexible than the current industry standard Docker-based containers. With Kubernetes running on top of ThreeFold‚Äôs ZMachine &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__grid_use?id=tfgrid-kubernetes-cloud&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we have a highly compatible and unique solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

It provides a unique advantage over traditional containers via the use of mini VMs. By employing mini VMs, the FList concept provides better isolation than traditional container systems while retaining the advantages that containers offer over full VMs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;kubernetes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#kubernetes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: kubernetes&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold has long supported the most used open-source container orchestration tool in the world, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which integrates the industry standard &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; format, a container creation and management tool. It‚Äôs used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments. Kubernetes can be used to create a production-ready environment. The ThreeFold Grid provides a lightweight Kubernetes VM that can be used to create clusters according to specific needs. By providing both VMs and Kubernetes, we‚Äôre able to offer the most comprehensive solution in the decentralized&#x2F;blockchain space to deploy, scale, and manage cloud compute workloads. Kubernetes users can, for the most part, simply bring their existing configuration files and recreate their deployments on a Grid based cluster seamlessly. With the third generation of the Grid, we provided a very simple way to provision &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual3_iac&#x2F;grid3_terraform&#x2F;manual__terraform_k8s?id=more-info&quot;&gt;Kubernetes clusters with Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

It also integrates directly with our Grid‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;threefold__usp_compatible?id=kubernetes&quot;&gt;existing Kubernetes functionality&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to offer a complete solution for reserving hardware and deploying software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Terraform offers a complete solution for reserving hardware and deploying software. It allows for specifying deployments on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_home&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a simple, declarative, and human-readable language describing the desired end state. Terraform can be used to deploy the full set of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; primitives, supporting any existing or future Linux workload, with endless possibilities. It is like a lower-level Kubernetes for the hardware part of cloud deployments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

By utilizing dedicated nodes on the ThreeFold Grid, you‚Äôll benefit from a truly decentralized and highly reliable Internet infrastructure that uses less energy and comes at a much more affordable price than any comparable alternative. With dedicated nodes, users are able to exclusively reserve the entire capacity of a 3Node to deploy solutions for themselves or for other customers, while also paying for all capacity of the respective 3Node. Dedicated nodes on our Grid will be highly cost effective, as they‚Äôll be available with a 70% discount on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;pricing-for-tfgrid&#x2F;2518&#x2F;7&quot;&gt;pricing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All the ThreeFold Grid features will be available on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;exciting-news-dedicated-nodes-on-the-people-s-internet&#x2F;2645?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;dedicated nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as well ‚Äì from deploying VMs and containers to CapRover and more. Dedicated and non-dedicated 3Nodes can be combined.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is built with simplicity in mind which is why we‚Äôre using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;partners&#x2F;vlang&#x2F;&quot;&gt;V&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì a statically typed programming language similar to Go, and inspired by Rust, Swift, and Oberon. It‚Äôs the official &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__smartcontract_it&quot;&gt;smart contract&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; language on the Grid, as its simplicity and readability allows anyone to go through and understand any code base, even non-developers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being simple, V gives a lot of power to the developer and can be used in pretty much every field, including systems programming, webdev, gamedev, GUI, mobile, science, embedded, tooling, etc. It aims to become an alternative to JavaScript as the de facto coding language on the market in the upcoming years. With V, the developer doesn‚Äôt need to change anything in their code. ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù, like in Python, Go, or Java, except there‚Äôs no heavy GC tracing everything or expensive RC for each object. V can translate your entire C project and offer you the safety, simplicity, and 10-25x faster compilation speeds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With +30,5K Stars on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vlang&#x2F;v&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, V brings a strong open-source developer community to the ThreeFold ecosystem to develop the infrastructures and applications of tomorrow ‚Äì making it the ideal smart contract language for the ThreeFold ecosystem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now that you‚Äôve learned more about the building blocks of the ThreeFold Grid and how you can build with them, we‚Äôd like to invite you to try and test them yourselves!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we‚Äôre very proud of our progress and the strong ecosystem around us, now‚Äôs the time to build upon the foundation. The team continues to do incredible work to further develop and advance the Grid with each and every release. They continue to improve the components, develop new features and build new solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With your support, the team can work even faster. If you share our belief in open source and decentralization, we invite you to help us test and improve not only the Grid and its primitives but also the solutions built on top. Together, we keep building and advancing to realize our Internet of Internets vision and to empower people with true digital sovereignty.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What started out as an idea for a better Internet about a decade ago amongst a few early Internet and Cloud pioneers has now become a reality. Today, ThreeFold is a global movement building a reliable, open and inclusive Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve reached a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Internet. And ThreeFold is ready to unlock a new Internet era ‚Äì one filled with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet-first-people-first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;abundance and opportunity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for all, one which is better for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planting-the-seeds&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our planet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Our open-source technology, future-facing ecosystem and collaborative community have the potential to drive this new era forward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, the Internet was always meant to be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;p2p-web3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where anyone could own hardware, and connect and exchange directly with full security and in full privacy ‚Äì without any entity in the middle. This is how the Internet began. But as demand grew, big tech began to monopolize its infrastructure and all the major platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, ThreeFold has been committed not only to delivering on the original promise of the Internet, but also to realizing our ultimate vision of a better future for all. For the past six years, we‚Äôve been building up an incredible full-stack, open-source, decentralized Internet, all &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-from-the-ground-up&#x2F;2057?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;from the ground-up&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We‚Äôve come a long way and the result is, well, exceptional. There is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; else out there like ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From creating our own blockchain-driven and highly secure &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;operating system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (which allows computers to become decentralized servers), to building an ultra-scalable &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;qsss&#x2F;threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe Storage System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a complete far &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-at-the-edge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;edge cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; computing platform and a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;planetary peer-to-peer network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; all accessible via a unique Smart Contract for IT on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf-chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we‚Äôre proud to have the most &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-at-the-edge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;complete edge infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to power the next-generation Internet era.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we‚Äôre taking concrete steps to further expand this infrastructure that offers a truly decentralized layer 0 for any blockchain or Internet application. Moreover, with the help of our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldtesting&quot;&gt;community of Grid testers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we‚Äôre continuously advancing the underlying technology and working towards making it usable for as many people and use cases as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision and technology have matured into the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-of-internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì a network of thousands of community-built and -owned Internets through which we strive to interconnect all of humanity. A new world is coming, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__technology&quot;&gt;our technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has the potential to revolutionize digitization on a global scale, across sectors. And yet we remain a hidden gem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what solutions does the ThreeFold Grid offer today already? And why exactly should you start to build on top of ThreeFold? Let‚Äôs explore some of the many possibilities available today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì A cutting-edge, highly scalable peer-to-peer infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThreeFold is growing the ThreeFold Grid by enabling a community of thousands of farmers from around the world to participate and own a piece of the Internet.‚Äù ‚Äì &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;threefold_cybernews&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Adnan Fatayerji&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grid is a peer-to-peer cloud computing network that‚Äôs highly compatible with current industry standards. In late December 2021, ThreeFold launched the third generation of the ThreeFold Grid on mainnet with a fully functional tech stack ‚Äì a huge and crucial step towards a fully production-ready and decentralized infrastructure. The third generation not only brought a massive leap forward in the decentralization of the Grid but also made for a much simpler user experience for farmers and Grid users. People from all over the world are connecting thousands of 3Nodes to create the world‚Äôs largest decentralized Internet infrastructure, and new capacity is being connected every day. Find the latest Grid stats and utilization numbers in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;grid-stats-new-nodes-overview&#x2F;3291?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;this regularly updated thread&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold-2022-reflect-h1-outlook-h2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Over the past months&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the team evolved the Grid through version 3.6.1 and upgraded it to mainnet in July after receiving 100% community approval. This &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tfgrid-product-updates-july-2022-tfgrid-v3-6-1-highlights-and-more&#x2F;3206&#x2F;2?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;release&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; introduces more stability to the TF Grid and includes various upgrades and new features like the ThreeFold Connect App, the new unified dashboard for a simpler user experience, and more. Big progress was also made in terms of the DAO functionality that went live on TF Chain, with the first TF Chain (L1) DAO proposal was voted on and approved in August.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with each new Grid release, we‚Äôre getting one step closer to solidifying the foundation of the Internet of Internets. Currently, the team is working towards completing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-updates-august-2022&#x2F;3272?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Grid version 3.7.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which includes some significant updates, improvements and new features like FreeFlow Twin, a new Node Pilot, new deployment features and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-updates-august-2022&#x2F;3272?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;a lot more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The team continues to do incredible work to further develop and advance the Grid as well as to support utilization and adoption by offering tools and applications that are user-friendly, secure, efficient and scalable. A massive thank you to our incredible tech team and the community of Grid testers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The ThreeFold Token is Built for Growth &amp; Key to the Internet of Internets</title>
		<published>2022-08-31T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-token-built-for-growth/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the blockchain space is flooded with as many as 22,000 coins and tokens and for several months now, the market has been struggling at large with some coins even collapsing. A thorough shakeout could expose those tokens and coins purely focused on making quick profits and creating hype, and mitigate pump-and-dump schemes. Now‚Äôs the time for projects like us to shine ‚Äì projects with tokens that serve a higher purpose and come with sound tokenomics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tft-an-accessible-utility-token&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tft-an-accessible-utility-token&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tft-an-accessible-utility-token&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;TFT ‚Äì An Accessible Utility Token&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre an Internet infrastructure project building the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; together with a growing community around the world. So, TFT is not just any token. TFT is our native utility token, and as such, is backed by the continuous growth of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__newtotokens?id=threefold-token-for-beginners&quot;&gt;utility tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are created to give digital access to specific products or services. While they do provide value in different ways, they cannot be considered ‚Äúmoney‚Äù as directly as coins can be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the utility token and medium of exchange of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__grid_intro&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, TFT represents Internet capacity. It supports a truly decentralized Internet for all and is leveraged to access and scale our open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. TFT is and will remain our main token, it‚Äôs our global currency. In a nutshell, TFT is our way of incentivizing an open ecosystem where anyone can connect and utilize Internet capacity without any intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve made a lot of progress in making the ThreeFold Token more accessible and in creating a healthy financial ecosystem for it. Moreover, the team is building our own DeFi solutions. You can learn more about our efforts towards providing a native financial system for the Internet of Internets &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;future_tft_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you‚Äôre new to ThreeFold, I recommend giving our ‚Äú&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__newtotokens&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token for Beginners&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;‚Äù page a read.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

The tokens are minted using our so-called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_capacity&quot;&gt;Proof of Capacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; algorithm. We‚Äôre also exploring the possibility of providing farmers with booster rewards for certain achievements in areas like reliability and uptime, quality of bandwidth, level of utilization.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet_first_people_first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;planet-first people-first philosophy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we‚Äôve implemented a Voluntary Carbon Credits system in the PoC algorithm, so every 3Node mints additional TFT to offset its own carbon emissions, as outlined &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive&#x2F;2097?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To incentivize the long-term growth of the ecosystem, a burning mechanism permanently removes TFT from the circulating supply, as this ensures scarcity and continuous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;farming rewards&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Burning will increase proportionally as the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_utilization&quot;&gt;utilization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Grid grows, ensuring the amount of TFT in the market is limited and leading to a healthy economic system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, many existing token holders expressed their confidence and support by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__vesting_overview&quot;&gt;vesting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; their TFT in 2021, further limiting the number of TFT circulating. Moreover, chances are that a growing number of token owners will hold onto their TFT ‚Äì because they expect the token to rise in value ‚Äì which will increase scarcity. Ultimately, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__threefold_token&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has the potential to become a valuable commodity, offering a more reliable alternative to other digital currencies like Bitcoin. The hoarding of TFT means that these tokens won‚Äôt be available to be used on the Grid, additionally reducing the amount of available TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are more factors potentially reinforcing scarcity. Staking is the mechanism to let the community invest and benefit from the growth of the Grid. Once the validator nodes can be deployed, validator owners and community members will be able to stake TFT on the validators which will secure the blockchain. To unlock voting rights and rewards, a certain amount of TFT has to be staked. Eventually, rewards for the validator owners could account for up to 50% of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__threefold_token&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; supply.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the token‚Äôs scarcity mechanisms with our staking and validator programs will lead to an increased scarcity of TFT on the market ‚Äì which, in turn, will allow our future DeFi solutions to sell TFT at a higher value.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don‚Äôt believe in hype or speculation, and we don‚Äôt spend any of our scarce resources on supporting speculation. We believe in the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which will interconnect us all, while providing us with digital sovereignty, privacy and meaningful experiences. We believe in the organic and sustainable growth of ThreeFold Token and the Internet of Internets vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with building community-owned Internets, our ecosystem is reimagining education, business, governance and more for a fair, inclusive and regenerative future ‚Äì opening up a new world of possibilities. And in order to connect such an ecosystem of Internets, a healthy and fair financial system with a strong, stable currency is key.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the glocal concept will be rolled out, the ThreeFold Token will unfold its &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-real-value-of-tft&#x2F;3143&quot;&gt;potential&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and flourish. The Internet of Internets empowers people to build their own regional Internet infrastructures and will become a huge stimulator for the TFT economy. Every Regional Internet will have its own self-sustaining liquidity pool, validators, and regional digital currencies ‚Äì with TFT acting as the reserve currency of the entire decentralized system. It is the currency needed to transfer between all the different Regional Internets via liquidity pools. TFT is also the currency of the main ThreeFold Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is not only for believers in open source and decentralization. ThreeFold, and TFT, are needed. TFT is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-real-value-of-tft&#x2F;3143&quot;&gt;much more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; than a simple token. It energizes the ThreeFold Grid and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expansion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of a truly decentralized Internet. There are many new ecosystem developments, tech advancements and building blocks for the Internet of Internets happening all around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization of the Internet of Internets combined with the previously mentioned burning and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_limited_supply&quot;&gt;scarcity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; mechanisms will trigger basic supply-and-demand mechanisms. The limited token supply will meet a rising demand for TFT. The token will be needed to buy and reserve current or future Internet capacity and services on our Grid as well as for driving the rollout and expansion of the Internet of Internets ‚Äì establishing the global Internets of Internets alone will require billions of TFT. In addition to that, TFT will be needed to access the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru&#x2F;3299&#x2F;12&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (formerly known as Uhuru) and to deploy workloads on the Grid, e.g. through weblets on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-focus-series-tf-playground-v3-7-0&#x2F;3315&#x2F;3&quot;&gt;TF Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All in all, there will be a natural economic demand for TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For farmers, developers and community members looking to build a better world, there has never been a better time to join the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;movement&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and take action.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The emergence of blockchain technology presented the world with new exciting opportunities ‚Äì from independent digital currencies and decentralized financial (DeFi) applications to smart contracts, consensus-driven voting systems, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Above all, blockchain technology held, and still holds, the promise of decentralization and transparency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somewhere along the way, much of the blockchain and crypto space started to return to principles and methods of the old financial system. Many projects out there seem to choose hype and fast profits over long-term growth and providing real value. Now, unsurprisingly, we‚Äôre experiencing a serious bear market, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022-bear-market-has-been-the-worst-on-record-glassnode&quot;&gt;the worst&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; crypto has seen to date.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn‚Äôt have to be a bad thing, though. And it won‚Äôt be, for projects like us who provide real value, bring impactful solutions, and take a different approach. The monetary system is clearly failing, we shouldn‚Äôt need to rely on central banks ‚Äì or even centralized exchanges for that matter. And we don‚Äôt have to!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in decentralization. And we believe that the future is decentralized. DeFi is great and fortunately, many decentralized alternatives already exist, with thriving ecosystems and communities. There are many options to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy&quot;&gt;buy and sell TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a decentralized way, including multiple options within the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thriving_with_stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stellar ecosystem&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì and we‚Äôre also exploring meaningful partnership opportunities with Algorand. Both Stellar and Algorand already provide everything we need for a healthy financial ecosystem and offer various functions crucial for the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ecosystem ‚Äì from order books to wallets to AMM liquidity pools and on&#x2F;off ramp options. And both have huge, thriving communities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these great decentralized options, we‚Äôve decided to develop our own DeFi solutions to support the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;growth and expansion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Internet of Internets and an abundance-based future where we are truly sovereign: community-based liquidity pools and the P2P DeFi Wallet. These DeFi solutions will be the foundation of the financial system for the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take a look at both of the innovative features and when to expect them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-threefold-liquidity-pools&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-threefold-liquidity-pools&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-are-threefold-liquidity-pools&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What are ThreeFold Liquidity Pools?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs community-based liquidity pools are a means of enabling the people and organizations within the ThreeFold ecosystem to exchange &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and to provide liquidity in a safe and decentralized way. They will become the main point of entry and exit for TFT. And everyone can be a part of this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-p2p-defi-wallet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-the-p2p-defi-wallet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-the-p2p-defi-wallet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is the P2P DeFi Wallet?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name P2P DeFi Wallet already gives away, this new wallet is a DeFi platform based on peer-to-peer principles. It will enable anyone to buy and sell TFT, and to trade it for other digital currencies in a highly secure and safe way within the wallet ‚Äì no need to integrate with other DeFi applications or exchanges. This prevents TFT from market manipulation and protects our community from abuse by financial bots. This wallet provides a solid, stable financial base for our token.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-are-these-new-defi-solutions-important-for-the-threefold-ecosystem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-are-these-new-defi-solutions-important-for-the-threefold-ecosystem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-are-these-new-defi-solutions-important-for-the-threefold-ecosystem&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why Are These New DeFi Solutions Important for the ThreeFold Ecosystem?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain ecosystems like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thriving_with_stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and Algorand are amazing and offer everything we need to organically grow the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And yet, we need additional mechanisms for liquidity providing which are designed to support the Internet of Internets. Many AMM DeFi pools are great and a step forward but not sufficient for certain use cases, e.g. DeFi pools usually don‚Äôt support bigger exchange trades, as the price would be too affected. Classic order book trading on-chain comes with its own set of limitations as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with building community-owned Internets, our ecosystem is reimagining education, business, governance and more for a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet_first_people_first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;fair, inclusive and regenerative future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì opening up a new world of possibilities. And in order to connect such an ecosystem of Internets, a healthy and fair financial system is key.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity pools and our P2P DeFi Wallet will work together. They are designed to improve the stability and liquidity of TFT, and will allow us to acquire as many tokens as possible from external sources. Buying back as many TFT as possible will not only lead to the rise and stabilization of the value of TFT ‚Äì it will also allow us to build a protected treasury that supports our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;co-owned future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as the TFT in the pools will be used to provide the community with liquidity as we grow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity pools and the new wallet are key to building our own liquid, peer-to-peer financial system based on Web 4 principles ‚Äì powering a new economic model and offering a fair, equally accessible and decentralized financial system for the Internet of Internets. Additionally, the liquidity coming from the pools and the wallet will enable us to accelerate the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expansion and Web 4 phases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of our journey towards building the future we want to live in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of TFT‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796&quot;&gt;scarcity mechanisms&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with our staking and validator programmes, will lead to an increased scarcity of TFT on the market ‚Äì which, in turn, will allow the liquidity pools and wallet to sell TFT at a higher value.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-the-tft-ecosystem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-future-of-the-tft-ecosystem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-future-of-the-tft-ecosystem&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Future of the TFT Ecosystem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in the organic growth of our token and the Internet of Internets vision. So, building our own sustainable, peer-to-peer DeFi system will mark a new chapter for the ThreeFold movement. And the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; concept will become a huge stimulator for the TFT economy, as every Regional Internet will have its own self-sustaining liquidity pool, validators, and regional TFTs ‚Äì with TFT acting as the reserve currency of the entire decentralized system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing our own DeFi solutions for the Internet of Internets will complement the opportunities of ecosystems like Stellar and Algorand, and enrich the TFT ecosystem. The community-based liquidity pools and P2P wallet are another major step in bringing a fair financial model that will create more opportunities and empower people from all over the world to co-create a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet_first_people_first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;better system for all&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited for these new solutions which are expected by early next year. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;Join the movement&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to stay updated on the TFT ecosystem!¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2014, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open network for storing, moving and trading any kind of money transparently and efficiently. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;intro-to-stellar&quot;&gt;decentralized system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; enables users ‚Äúto create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money‚Äù in a faster, cheaper and more energy-efficient way ‚Äì facilitating millions of transactions on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;2020&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold decided to move the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__token_what&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) to Stellar from Rivine (a transactional blockchain created by ThreeFold), which still is the main blockchain for the minting of TFT and the distribution of farming rewards. Internet capacity provisioning and workload deployments are executed via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Therefore, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bridges_connecting_threefold_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bridges&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between Stellar and TF Chain were established to facilitate payments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the blockchains TFT is available on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bridges_connecting_threefold_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-chose-stellar-what-the-network-offers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-we-chose-stellar-what-the-network-offers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-we-chose-stellar-what-the-network-offers&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why we chose Stellar &amp;amp; What the Network offers&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were and still are big fans of Stellar. Over the last two years, we‚Äôve had a great experience with Stellar. And we believe everything we need for a healthy financial ecosystem is already available on Stellar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stellar Network is faster, more cost-effective and more energy-efficient than usual blockchain-based systems. It‚Äôs a huge, highly reliable network that integrates a multitude of digital currencies and provides good liquidity. In addition to that, we share the same values and a similar vision: Stellar and ThreeFold are both open source, looking to empower humanity and striving towards building fair, inclusive systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar has a lot to offer, including:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-off-ramps&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#on-off-ramps&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: on-off-ramps&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;On&#x2F;Off Ramps&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar helps exchanges with enabling compliant &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.stellar.org&#x2F;stellar-for-exchanges&quot;&gt;on&#x2F;off ramps&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and thereby opens up exchanges‚Äô access to new markets, users and services&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar does so through native and interoperable on&#x2F;off-ramps within the Stellar Network, called anchors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All exchanges have to do is integrate assets like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;usdc&quot;&gt;Stellar USDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;order-books&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#order-books&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: order-books&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Order Books&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar has a built-in decentralized exchange, SDEX, which enables users to place orders to buy or sell one Stellar-network asset for another&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These orders are aggregated into so-called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stellar.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-automated-market-makers-on-stellar&quot;&gt;order books&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and prioritized for execution based on price&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order book model is very established ‚Äì it‚Äôs the same model used by traditional exchanges where users trade forex or cryptocurrencies&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, order books on decentralized money chains are pretty straightforward, while basically offering the same functionalities as centralized exchanges&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order book on Stellar is relatively small but as people start using it it will get bigger, there is no downside compared to Liquid&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TFT is also available on order books on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;usdc&quot;&gt;Stellar USDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;automated-market-makers-amms&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#automated-market-makers-amms&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: automated-market-makers-amms&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Automated Market Makers (AMMs)&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;developers-blog&#x2F;protocol-18-upgrade-complete&quot;&gt;November 2021&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Stellar natively supports the creation of AMMs to improve liquidity and to thereby make cross-border payments fast, cheap, and highly usable&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMMs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stellar.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-automated-market-makers-on-stellar&quot;&gt;coexist alongside&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the SDEX as an alternate source of liquidity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They democratize access by making the process of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stellar.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;amms-in-the-stellar-ecosystem&quot;&gt;providing liquidity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; accessible, simple, and inclusive while making asset conversion more efficient&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While users trade against other users‚Äô existing orders in the order book model, users trade against a liquidity pool with AMMs&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMMs on Stellar are a great opportunity to provide easily accessible liquidity at scale, especially for markets that are new and&#x2F;or overlooked by traditional market makers, as issuers of an asset on Stellar don‚Äôt have to rely on market makers anymore ‚Äì with AMMs, they can set up liquidity pools and enable individuals to provide liquidity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small fees incur when trading against a liquidity pool to incentivize liquidity providers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;wallets&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#wallets&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: wallets&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Wallets¬†&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar provides a number of different &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;ecosystem&#x2F;projects?tab=wallets#Wallets&quot;&gt;wallets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with various functionalities, both hardware and software wallets, to make it really simple for users to enter the Stellar Network ‚Äì from LOBSTR and Solar to StellarX and Trezor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, Stellar offers multiple great solutions and basically everything we need. It‚Äôs all there ‚Äì order books, AMMs, wallets, and more ‚Äì and it‚Äôs decentralized! Now, we only have to start building our own liquidity on Stellar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since every asset and currency starts with zero liquidity when issued on Stellar, it is up to the community to put capital onto the Stellar Network and to put that capital to use for trading, e.g. by creating orders on the order books, to build liquidity on Stellar ‚Äì i.e. to create and sustain a healthy market for TFT. Therefore, we encourage you all to choose Stellar as the primary platform to trade TFT. If all of us together put our liquidity there, we‚Äôll be able to create a very healthy TFT ecosystem, and thereby also attract others to get involved in TFT. Actually, this is a great chance for us to take back control of and strengthen the token ‚Äì without any interferences or manipulations from centralized exchanges. Together, we build.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;usdc&quot;&gt;Stellar USDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; brings the world‚Äôs fastest-growing USD stablecoin to Stellar, an incredibly efficient and fast network. Through Stellar USDC, a fully-backed and trusted digital US Dollar asset, dollars can now move anywhere and to anyone, across borders, and be immediately converted into and out of the world‚Äôs currencies.

&lt;p&gt;Basically, selling and buying TFT is possible via all the above and below mentioned interfaces and wallets within the Stellar Network through &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;usdc&quot;&gt;Stellar USDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;One of our key objectives is to make TFT more accessible. Already, there are many options to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy&quot;&gt;buy and sell TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettft.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;gettft.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or Stellar‚Äôs DEX, and more coming soon. We‚Äôre also exploring the feasibility and synergies for a meaningful partnership with Algorand ‚Äì including making TFT available on Algorand order books.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the team is doing some incredible work on developing our own financial technologies, including the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;liquidity.threefold.me&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Liquidity Pool concept and the P2P Wallet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, both expected by early next year.

While rising inflation rates, a downward market and crypto winter have many projects struggling, these market conditions favour those who are building and providing technology with real-world value over those who are just creating hype. The dust always settles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While exhibiting at conferences, hosting gatherings and entertaining countless conversations, we were assured that the world is looking for decentralized infrastructure projects that provide truly innovative technology. Still today, blockchain and Web 3 projects hold very low utility. Jack Dorsey‚Äôs plans to build a platform called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopotato.com&#x2F;jack-dorsey-snubs-web-3-for-all-new-web-5-platform&#x2F;&quot;&gt;‚ÄòWeb 5‚Äô&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is just another example of market dynamics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with each new Grid release, we‚Äôre getting one step closer to solidifying the foundation of the Internet of Internets. The team is working hard to further develop and advance the Grid. A massive thank you to our incredible tech team and the community of Grid testers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this agreement, ThreeFold Tech and OpenNebula Systems will set up technical collaboration and joint research on edge computing involving the open-source technology developed as part of the H2020 innovation project ONEedge (2019-2022) and the highly-distributed peer-to-peer edge infrastructure available through the ThreeFold Grid in order to create Edge-as-a-Service environments. Both companies will also seek to integrate additional open-source components developed by ThreeFold Tech and OpenNebula Systems, involving the Linux operating system and the Kubernetes platform for container orchestration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOpenNebula Systems is seeking to increase the number of cloud&#x2F;edge providers and the associated infrastructure resources available to OpenNebula users through our Provider Catalog,‚Äù said OpenNebula System‚Äôs VP of Open Source Community Relations, Alberto P.

		<title>Building the Future We Want to Live In ‚Äì A Four Step Journey</title>
		<published>2022-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/four-phases-of-threefold/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/four-phases-of-threefold/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What started out as an idea for a better Internet about a decade ago has evolved into a global movement that‚Äôs building a decentralized, open and inclusive future through &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The journey towards our ultimate vision of a better future for all is a big one, but can be divided into four digestible phases: creation, expansion, Web 4 and velocity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-phase-of-creation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-the-phase-of-creation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-the-phase-of-creation&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;1 The Phase of Creation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past six years, we‚Äôve been building up an incredible full-stack, open-source, decentralized Internet infrastructure, all from the ground-up. From creating our own decentralized operating system, to building a Quantum Safe Storage System, a complete far edge cloud computing platform and planetary peer-to-peer network all accessible via a unique Smart Contract for IT on the ThreeFold Blockchain, we‚Äôre proud to have the most complete edge infrastructure to power the next-generation Internet era. A new world is coming, and our technology has the potential to revolutionize digitization on a global scale, across sectors. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation phase was about developing the key tech components and an initial deployment of our infrastructure worldwide. The ThreeFold Grid is now live in its third generation and the stack is fully functional. As of today, people from all across the world have connected more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;threefold_io&#x2F;status&#x2F;1529903015938998272&quot;&gt;3,000 nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; across +78 countries to create the world‚Äôs largest decentralized Internet infrastructure, and new capacity is being connected every day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fully comprehensive decentralized edge cloud solutions, the ThreeFold ecosystem is also developing a range of applications and experiences across IoT, metaverse, blockchain, DeFi, banking, education and beyond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase of creation is almost complete. The ThreeFold team is currently working on the Digital Twin solution that will allow the ecosystem to tap into Web 4 principles ‚Äì a paradigm that overcomes the limitations of Web 2 and the inefficiencies of Web 3. By advancing our technology further, ThreeFold will be in a unique position to open new frontiers and support emerging global trends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-phase-of-expansion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-the-phase-of-expansion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-the-phase-of-expansion&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;2 The Phase of Expansion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase is all about the growth of the ThreeFold Grid and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;connecting_the_dots&#x2F;&quot;&gt;connecting the dots&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. From individual farmers and farming cooperatives connecting Internet capacity independently to our global network, to building Community Clouds and Regional Internets for countries, various pathways to Grid growth have been established by the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Internets will interconnect us all, while providing us with digital sovereignty, privacy and meaningful experiences. It focuses on incentivizing local communities to build their own resilient Community Clouds to support their city, town or village with the foundation to build their decentralized future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on their geographic proximity, Community Clouds will be able to form Regional Internets. Each Regional Internet will be equipped with their own blockchain, validators and liquidity providers as well as local digital experiences in order to remain independent from the rest of the world. In that sense, whatever would happen to the Internet infrastructure outside of the borders of that region would not affect local connectivity and digital economies. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Regional Internets will be interconnected by the ThreeFold Hub on a global level to create the Internet of Internets. This model is infinitely scalable. Instead of relying on one global network and blockchain, ThreeFold will allow for many independent and interoperable Internet infrastructures that support local communities with a platform to build their own blockchain, DeFi, metaverse, IoT, eCommerce solutions, and much more. Each layer has its own distinct purpose and enables seamless ecosystem-wide interactions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paradise_hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Paradise Hills partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the first proof of concept for Community Clouds and our team working with governments in multiple countries, we‚Äôre following the glocal approach of applying the global Internet of Internets concept locally with regional context. With our growing community and ecosystem supporting us, and building new relationships, we‚Äôre well set to turn the Internet of Internets into reality in the upcoming years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase of expansion will probably never end. ThreeFold is infinitely scalable, and there are many reasons to continue growing the ThreeFold Grid as it is best positioned to service the emerging demand for edge computing and sovereign Internet infrastructure for decades to come.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-phase-of-web-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#3-the-phase-of-web-4&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 3-the-phase-of-web-4&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;3 The Phase of Web 4&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the expansion phase, the rollout of the Web 4 phase is expected to kick off later this year to re-imagine business, governance, finance, education and more in order to provide better alternatives for people, enterprises and governments. Essentially, the Internet of Internets is laying the foundational infrastructure, and Web 4 technology will open a world of new possibilities around peer-to-peer and self-sovereign systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web 4 phase will empower people to become 100% self-sovereign with a range of decentralized alternatives to Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome, Zoom and much more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multitude of valuable and meaningful experiences are being built by the ThreeFold ecosystem and partners to empower people with equal chances to learn, create, and thrive in a decentralized digital economy ‚Äì what we like to call an abundance-based future for humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to all of this is ThreeFold‚Äôs open-source Digital Twin technology. It provides a unique digital identity that can serve as the key to an open, self-sovereign and complete digital future. The Digital Twin technology allows ThreeFold to flip the current centralized client-server model upside down, empowering people to become the masters of their own destiny. No more data being collected by servers and sold to third-parties ‚Äì you become the center of your digital life. There will be more on Digital Twin and its potential to change everything coming very soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with strategic partnerships being formed across the four corners of the globe, the Web 4 phase will support the ThreeFold Foundation‚Äôs vision of providing access to a better Internet paradigm to a billion people by 2030.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-the-phase-of-velocity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#4-the-phase-of-velocity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 4-the-phase-of-velocity&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;4 The Phase of Velocity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the Internet of Internets and the build-up of powerful experiences on Web 4 technology will bring the ecosystem to its fourth phase ‚Äì Velocity. At that moment in time, it will be all about utilization, economic growth and the acceleration of our collective vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tokenomics&quot;&gt;ThreeFold tokenomics&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have been designed to support a decentralized Internet economy that incentivizes participants to host nodes, validate the blockchain and build applications on the ThreeFold Grid. The moment utilization kicks in at a large scale on Web 4, the ThreeFold Ecosystem will be ready to reach millions ‚Äì and eventually, billions ‚Äì of users through powerful digital experiences that provide a better alternative than today‚Äôs paradigm. As of today, 35% of ThreeFold Token transactions under Proof of Utilization are burned to create a deflationary economy. This will create additional &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__grid_valuation&quot;&gt;value&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the token ecosystem as it will reduce the circulating supply in relation to the increasing demand for ThreeFold‚Äôs infrastructure. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the fourth phase will drive significant utilization of the ThreeFold Token and support in positioning it as the Bitcoin for Internet capacity. It will open up a decentralized Internet economy full of opportunities, empowerment and meaningful experiences for people all around the world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúA dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.‚Äù ‚Äì John Lennon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve reached a pivotal moment in the evolution of ThreeFold to support our world in solving some of its greatest challenges. A complete and resilient Internet infrastructure owned by local communities is an essential way to build a circular and participatory economy. Considering that the Internet is the second largest and fastest growing economy in the world, the Internet of Internets represents a foundation for a decentralized and abundant world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; model supports ThreeFold in achieving its vision of providing Internet access to more than a billion people worldwide. And we believe that if we work together, we can connect all of humanity responsibly. Driven by our planet-first, people-first philosophy, the ThreeFold movement is shaping the world we want to live in and laying the foundation for an open, inclusive and abundance-based future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current phase of expansion is vital to turn our vision into reality and to fulfill our mission. Let‚Äôs build this world of opportunity and abundance together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/threefold-cybernews/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Q&amp;amp;A originally appeared &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybernews.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;adnan-fatayerji-threefold-the-best-protection-is-ownership-and-sovereignty-over-your-own-online-data&#x2F;&quot;&gt;on CyberNews&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every action done online leaves a trace of our personal data that can then be accessed by third parties. Unfortunately, this puts our privacy at risk and can lead to dangerous consequences.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our sensitive information falls into the wrong hands, one can encounter identity theft and suffer enormous financial losses. Thus, it‚Äôs essential to explore how the Internet could become a safer place for everyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybernews.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CyberNews&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; asked Adnan Fatayerji, the CEO of ThreeFold Foundation, to explain how blockchain technology can empower users and give them ownership over their own online data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ThreeFold originate? What has your journey been like?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with ThreeFold began in 2015. I was a serial entrepreneur up to this point, inspired by the energy and opportunity Dubai had to offer when I first arrived more than a decade prior. I had recently co-founded a company that worked with panoramic stitching and used an incredible piece of technology ‚Äì we got a lot of interest and were quickly acquired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, a mutual friend and a business partner introduced me to Kristof de Spiegeleer. He shared his view of the problems with the Internet, with centralized data centers, the Internet‚Äôs stack, storage, and computation, and how they needed improvement in ways that serve the underserved around the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristof expressed that he had been trying to resolve these problems for a long time and he thought he had the pieces to the puzzle, especially with the advent of blockchain which offered new and exciting possibilities. He thought we would hit it off, and we did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôve built ThreeFold and even created a new operating system ‚Äì Zero OS. It is more energy-efficient and runs completely in an autonomous and decentralized way. It‚Äôs the first of its kind, built off of Linux.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold journey has been a vast school of knowledge for me while working with incredible co-founders and mentors who have helped build pieces of the IT world as we know it. It has truly changed my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about what you do? What are your main fields of focus at the moment?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, I‚Äôve been in charge of the ThreeFold Foundation which is building a global movement around the ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì a peer-to-peer, open-source, and decentralized Internet. I‚Äôm also active in our fundraising, business, and ecosystem development efforts. It‚Äôs an honor every day to wake up and be a part of a global movement of people who are trying to build a better Internet for humanity that can uplift and empower.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are focused on building Neighborhood Clouds on ThreeFold that allow home and business owners to transform their own neighborhood into a decentralized, distributed data center by becoming a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Each home, office, or commercial property can host a 3Node ‚Äì a dedicated server that provides the edge computing and Internet storage needed to run decentralized applications and Internet services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Nodes are interconnected using existing local Internet cable infrastructure. They offer a quantum-safe storage system with the capacity to host a metaverse, gaming, rendering cloud, compute cloud, and a platform for our digital applications that enable our daily digital life. Farmers, in turn, are rewarded every month in ThreeFold Tokens (TFT), a digital currency, for adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently announced a historic partnership in Dubai with Paradise Hills Development to provide every homeowner in a 170-home gated community with a pre-installed 3Node. The initiative will provide residents, businesses, developers, and the government with a secure and highly accessible sovereign cloud infrastructure to run a vast array of applications and internet services, as well as store and process their data locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is evident that open source is an important part of ThreeFold. Would you like to share more about your vision?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned the democratization of the financial system through decentralization, ThreeFold is on a similar quest to democratize the Internet with open-source, autonomous, and blockchain technologies. ThreeFold has built the open-source technology behind the decentralized storage and compute capacity of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Internet users can benefit from a neutral, peer-to-peer platform on which to store their data and run their applications privately and securely. Moreover, decentralization can help to remove the Internet‚Äôs singular potential points of failure which could seriously disrupt the global Internet and Cloud industry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decentralized Internet can also better serve underserved populations of the world, including indigenous populations across the globe. We believe in open-source and we are partnering with technology companies, governments, and indigenous communities to expand the Internet in underserved regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the recent global events had an effect on the way people approach the blockchain landscape?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent global events have definitely had an effect and spotlighted the fact that we need to consider new approaches to our IT systems with the blockchain landscape being one of them. A good example of the power of blockchain technology along with digital currency is Ukraine‚Äôs thriving fundraising. As the war began, a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;i-created-a-dao-for-laughs-want-to-join&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Decentralized Autonomous Organization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (DAO) was set up so that the government could accept cryptocurrency directly from donors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. First is the lack of trust needed between the two parties. A traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it, especially on behalf of investors. With DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold DAO allows autonomous operation of the TFChain and ThreeFold Grid. At ThreeFold, we believe that decentralization is needed across a wide array of systems, including organizations, to build a better Internet. Decentralization typically brings more resilience, equality, and fairness. As such, we apply this in a variety of ways across our own structures and practices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, the blockchain community needs to look at the vulnerability of the blockchain‚Äôs underlying infrastructure. Today, many are run on centralized cloud services and in a time of conflict can be vulnerable to hacks or attacks. I think this is where ThreeFold aligns so well with the blockchain industry since we provide the missing layer needed to be secure, scale, and remain decentralized.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since blockchain is a relatively new technology, there are still some confusion and myths surrounding them. What misconceptions do you notice most often?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the common misconceptions and misunderstandings about blockchain is that people often think cryptocurrency and blockchain are the same. Blockchain is a ledger and cryptocurrency is an alternative means of financial transaction. Cryptocurrency (or Digital Currency) is powered by blockchain, but blockchain does not need a cryptocurrency to function. 
Here‚Äôs how blockchain and digital currency work on ThreeFold:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer 2 (L2): the ecosystem security layer.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The ThreeFold DAO and ThreeFold Token (TFT) live here. It‚Äôs our main chain with 100 validators and it secures the multiple Layer 1 (L1) networks. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer 1 (L1): the Internet of Blockchains layer.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; It‚Äôs ultimately scaleable because of thousands or millions of blockchains. It‚Äôs like a side chain for the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer Zero (L0): the IT capacity layer and the cloud computer layer.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; ThreeFold executors live on this layer, secured by L0 Validators. L0 provides compute, storage, and network resources to L1 and L2.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the ThreeFold Token (TFT) is the first token in the world that gives access to the most comprehensive, decentralized Internet capacity for computing, storage, networking, and soon GPUs. Look at it as &lt;em&gt;the Bitcoin for Internet Capacity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users, developers, and enterprises can use TFT to store data, build applications, and create peer-to-peer ecosystems on the ThreeFold Grid. ThreeFold Farmers are rewarded in TFT for contributing capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As more companies move their workload to the cloud, are there any details that might be overlooked when making the switch?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vastly overlooked detail about the current cloud landscape is that it is energy-hungry and unsustainable given the rate at which our digital demands are growing today. If your company is working to be more environmentally conscious and meet climate goals, cloud hosting might have been overlooked as a contributing factor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet‚Äôs growth is exponential: 5.25 billion people have Internet access and are active users, so that‚Äôs about 66% of the world‚Äôs population. Since 2000, the number of Internet users has increased by 1,355%. The rate at which hyper-scale data centers need to be built to keep up with hosting these clouds is unrealistic, and their price     tags are exorbitant considering there are more efficient ways to tackle this issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ThreeFold, companies can now literally be their own data centers, without the data security risks, latency and downtime issues, or hosting expenses. We believe that the current centralized cloud infrastructure carries increasing risk and it delivers poorly for underserved populations of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs crazy to think that more than 80% of today‚Äôs Internet infrastructure is owned by less than 20 organizations. The lack of ownership of our own data and the consequent commercialization of our data is a major concern for both individuals and governments alike. Neutrality and democratization of the Internet are an absolute necessity regarding the future of the Internet and cloud architecture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What security measures do you think are crucial both for casual Internet users and large organizations?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting our personal data is crucial for any individual or entity participating online. There are many precautions and measures that can be taken but the best protection is ownership and sovereignty over your own online data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From data breaches to DoS attacks to hacked interfaces, cloud computing is under constant attack. ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized cloud offers improved security through a new, secure operating system, Zero OS, that runs on ThreeFold 3Nodes. It has no shell so that farmers ‚Äì the owners of the capacity that hosts the OS and the workloads ‚Äì have no access to the data nor the applications running on their hardware.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This OS is booted over the network with cryptographic boot file verification to prevent physical disk access and man-in-the-middle attacks. All nodes have their own IPv6 address and are fully interconnected in the defined network. Additionally, all traffic on the network is encrypted and inaccessible by TF Farmers or hackers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold also offers a Quantum-Safe File System. This File System can be used inside VMs or Kubernetes. This is an amazing feature because it allows you to store endless amounts of data in a Virtual Machine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs also added security. Deployment of IT workloads using a so-called ‚ÄúSmart Contract for IT‚Äù makes the deployment process resilient to human error and hacking. The system is self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure or services. This represents a breakthrough in IT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your predictions for the future of blockchain technology?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once mainstream organizations become more familiar with the technology and how to use it effectively, adoption will increase. It‚Äôs already happening and it‚Äôs being merged with other emerging technologies to create scale and efficiency across sectors. We will see a new and more refined era of blockchain technology where functional use cases drive the narrative.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share with us, what does the future hold for ThreeFold?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is growing the ThreeFold Grid by enabling a community of thousands of farmers from around the world to participate and own a piece of the Internet. Check out our map to see if your region is lit up yet. We believe that the decentralized Internet is key to a sustainable future so that we can deliver on the true promise of the Internet and make it more widely available and affordable for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuously improving the ThreeFold Grid. We just announced the release of ThreeFold Grid V3.0.0 Alpha-5 with significant upgrades, improvements, and fixes. Users can now choose to deploy applications and services on dedicated 3Nodes or reserve an entire 3Node, then use it exclusively to deploy solutions for themselves or other customers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with V3, the ThreeFold Grid is now operating as a DAO. We have also made it easier for users to buy ThreeFold Tokens by trading their BTC on our official &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettft.com&#x2F;gettft&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TFT Shop website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are announcing several promising partnerships and use cases in 2022 and are working closely with several nations to help establish a decentralized and sovereign infrastructure that will improve Internet accessibility, security, and locally provisioned capacity. You can learn more about it at threeFold.io.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Already, these developments are shifting the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;Internet‚Äôs ‚Äúcenter of gravity‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from its core to the edges in order to keep up with the growing demand. In an increasingly interconnected world, centralized cloud architectures are proving to be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;forbestechcouncil&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;demystifying-edge-technology&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bottlenecks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; hindering future growth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some interesting numbers to emphasize the explosive growth of connected devices and the impending data explosion:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in 2018, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;90% of global data creation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; took place within the two previous years.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2022, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;4.95 billion people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are using the Internet and about &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;2.5 quintillion bytes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of data are created on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 2 billion computers, 15 billion mobile devices and more than 22 billion IoT devices are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;active worldwide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 2025, more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;executive-perspectives&#x2F;annual-internet-report&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;1 billion people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;471264&#x2F;iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide&#x2F;#:%7E:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20%2D%20number%20of%20connected%20devices%20worldwide%202015%2D2025&amp;amp;text=By%202025%2C%20forecasts%20suggest%20that,IoT%20installed%20base%20in%202019.&quot;&gt;75 billion IoT devices&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are expected to join the Internet.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the expansion of Internet capacity still largely occurs in the same centralized and inefficient way. The client-server model of hyperscale data centers is unable to meet this rapidly growing demand due to high building and operational costs to fulfill bandwidth, performance and cybersecurity requirements. As data centers are primarily built in the US, China and Europe, emerging countries have to be connected via sea cables which makes the model‚Äôs limitations particularly severe for these countries. And even in countries where many data centers are located, they are built in regions where land and electricity are as cheap as possible. Consequently, the bulk of data centers is still &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;far away&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from where the majority of users and connected devices reside, and where huge amounts of data are generated that require processing ‚Äì resulting in a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__grid_valuation?id=what39s-the-potential-of-the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;weak distribution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Internet capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seagate.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;www-content&#x2F;our-story&#x2F;rethink-data&#x2F;files&#x2F;Rethink_Data_Report_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;175 Zettabytes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of data will be created by 2025, as our economy becomes increasingly digital and data driven. And this amount of data needs to be captured, stored and activated in a secure, efficient and high-performing way. So, the aforementioned technological use cases will not only &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbre.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;insights&#x2F;reports&#x2F;north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2021&quot;&gt;accelerate the demand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Internet capacity but also require edge capabilities, such as low latencies, in order to run and scale successfully. In fact, the centralized data center model poses one of the biggest obstacles to the success and spread of the Internet of Things and related applications. This will have to change. Actually, industry experts &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-scoop.eu&#x2F;edge-computing-explained&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expect 75%&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of data to be processed outside of the traditional data center or cloud model by 2025.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rise-of-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-rise-of-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-rise-of-edge-computing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The rise of edge computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing needs to be pushed from centralized data centers to the edge to support the massive data consumption coupled to the rise of connected devices and emerging technologies. For instance, as more and more home appliances and devices are getting interconnected through the IoT economy, the amount of real-time data generated within our homes on a daily basis is rapidly expanding. Edge computing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-scoop.eu&#x2F;edge-computing-explained&#x2F;&quot;&gt;tackles the shortcomings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the centralized model in terms of bandwidth, latency and autonomy. It enables applications and solutions to be hosted closer to where their data is being produced and consumed, thereby allowing for low latencies, rapid data processing and real-time decisions.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry analyst company &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idc.com&#x2F;getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48772522&quot;&gt;IDC estimates&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the global spending on edge computing to increase by 14.8% compared to 2021 ‚Äì amounting to roughly $176 billion in 2022. By 2025, this number is predicted to reach about $274 billion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of edge computing‚Äôs ability to process data on-site is simple enough. Nevertheless, edge computing fails to deliver on its promise as it still remains somewhat centralized today. Granted, so-called edge data centers are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stlpartners.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;edge-computing&#x2F;edge-data-centres&#x2F;&quot;&gt;closer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to where the data is being consumed than hyperscale data centers. But while they do provide an improvement from traditional data centers, they are not able to provide &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefastmode.com&#x2F;expert-opinion&#x2F;23002-what-are-various-types-of-edge-computing-that-exist-today&quot;&gt;far-edge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; capabilities, i.e. moving as close to the user and point of data creation as possible. They are simply smaller types of data centers that are still operated in a centralized manner, require the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;connectorsupplier.com&#x2F;how-the-rise-of-edge-computing-will-reshape-the-data-center-landscape&#x2F;&quot;&gt;same infrastructure elements&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as centralized data centers, and usually &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techtarget.com&#x2F;searchdatacenter&#x2F;definition&#x2F;edge-data-center&quot;&gt;rely&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on bigger, central data centers. Quite edgy isn‚Äôt it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the need for Internet capacity ‚Äì specifically at the edge ‚Äì is rapidly intensifying, a new approach to Internet infrastructure is clearly needed. The Web 3 movement created a spur of interest across industries due to its promise to decentralize the Internet and cloud as we know it. Future data will be generated at the edge of the network and Internet which certainly requires an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;forbestechcouncil&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;demystifying-edge-technology&#x2F;&quot;&gt;architectural shift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; away from the current model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;realizing-an-interconnected-future&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#realizing-an-interconnected-future&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: realizing-an-interconnected-future&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Realizing an interconnected future&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, decades after the spark of the open-source peer-to-peer Internet movement was steamrolled by large tech companies and governments eager to centralize the global Internet, we seem to enter an era of decentralization again. There‚Äôs no doubt that large tech companies did bring a lot of innovation to our global Internet and cloud stack. Technically though, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;p2p_web3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; systems have always been the most scalable option. Moreover, open-source architectures have built a strong reputation for providing high levels of security and flexibility.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peer-to-peer model, people and devices are able to exchange directly, without intermediaries or servers in the middle ‚Äì leading to a more energy-efficient, scalable and flexible paradigm that can expand on-demand. And undoubtedly, open-source will play a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.crunchbase.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;edge-computing-said-quissal-zededa&#x2F;&quot;&gt;key role&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in edge computing by simplifying and enhancing the building and deployment of software at the edge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging open-source and peer-to-peer technologies, ThreeFold has come up with an Internet infrastructure that is capable of far-edge computing. ThreeFold offers a powerful set of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;compute primitives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that provide the agility to create and deploy containers, Virtual Machines (VMs) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zkube?id=zkube&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; environments at the edge. Having integrated all leading industry-standard tools, ThreeFold‚Äôs solution allows for a seamless migration of any digital workload, making ThreeFold the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. And all data produced by these workloads can be stored in a way that is ultra safe, highly reliable and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;qsss&#x2F;threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system&quot;&gt;unbreakable&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Combined with end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__planetary_network?id=planetary-network&quot;&gt;networking&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, applications can be hosted closer to where the data is being consumed ‚Äì representing the ideal underlying layer for IoT networks, blockchain-based workloads and more to run and scale at the edge seamlessly, efficiently and privately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift towards the edge is inevitable. ThreeFold is the first full-stack, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincheckup.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;decentralized&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure in the world that combines compute in the form of highly-optimized containers, storage and network capacity in an all-in-one solution.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Internet economy is largely managed by centralized companies that connect servers and storage space to run web content. These companies are responsible for critical decisions that affect the Internet at large. They decide how user data is collected, stored, analyzed, and used, leaving people with little to no privacy or control over their identity and information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant corporations such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google have been pioneering the Web 2.0 era, also known as the Cloud era. Over the past 25 years, they have built the most efficient data centers and networks to support the growth of the digital world. However, throughout the last decade, the inherent risks attached to the single points of failures and security issues related to centralized servers and APIs have raised major concerns for Internet users and countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rising popularity of blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies, a gold rush around the decentralization of the Internet has already started. While many projects have attempted to decentralize the Internet and the Cloud with blockchain technology, a layer-0 is still missing for Web 3.0 and DeFi to scale to mass adoption.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a project called ThreeFold has joined the race after recently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;kisspr&#x2F;technology-middle-east-lifestyle-blockchain-dubai-079a0c910c55187206c58992347a8a1e&quot;&gt;announcing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the launch of the first neighborhood cloud in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>What Bitcoin did to money, ThreeFold is doing to the Internet</title>
		<published>2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/bitcoin-threefold/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/bitcoin-threefold/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The world‚Äôs most famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, established in 2008 by a person or group of people under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, is changing the world. With 106 million people owning Bitcoin after only twelve years, the growth momentum is undeniable. The popularity of Bitcoin is transforming monetary systems at large, and establishing trust through irrefutable records.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional financial technologies, Bitcoin provides total control over one‚Äôs funds without the intervention of a central authority, such as a bank or government. Bitcoin is decentralized and spread across many computers worldwide. It‚Äôs not a company, it‚Äôs a protocol. No single person or entity can control, manipulate or influence the network‚Äôs operations. There has never been a hack at the network level since Bitcoin launched in 2009.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin sparked a revolution towards decentralized and peer-to-peer systems. The advantage of such systems is that they operate without central authority, can be audited by anyone, and push for collaboration as their designs are public, inviting everyone to take part.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New systems built from scratch, like DeFi (decentralized finance), don‚Äôt have the problem of legacy firms, but they face challenges in scaling towards mass adoption. Most of the so-called ‚ÄòWeb3‚Äô solutions provide the illusion of decentralization but are actually still quite centralized. Others still have to prove their scalability, security and accessibility to become real alternatives to the current tech giants. While that may change, it‚Äôs not a given considering the clear limitations they have to overcome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet represents the second largest and fastest growing economy in the world. With plenty of technologies emerging such as Blockchain, Web3, IoT and the Metaverse to name just a few, the infrastructure that holds our digital world together is becoming more important than ever before. However, the Internet is struggling with many issues related to its incredibly centralized model, including a lack of resiliency and scalability, as well as the loss of its neutrality. And these issues keep intensifying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services alone hosts more than a third of the Internet today. Adding in a few other tech giants, we essentially end up with only four or five companies controlling the majority of the Internet. While the US government has been debating potential regulations and even breakups of big tech corporations, other governments like China or Russia are already regulating certain aspects of the web. However, most regulations have failed to achieve the desired outcomes and are unable to keep up with the pace of innovations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a saying that goes, ‚ÄúIf it is free, you are the product.‚Äù Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are known for being completely free of charge. Their business models and profits are based on collecting, analyzing and selling their users‚Äô data. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcleanhospital.org&#x2F;essential&#x2F;it-or-not-social-medias-affecting-your-mental-health&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; now show that high social media use correlates with self-reported declines in mental and physical health. The same platforms are being manipulated by private companies that spread political disinformation and polarity. According to internal Facebook &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;26&#x2F;21270659&#x2F;facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms&quot;&gt;reports&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, 64% of the people that joined extremist groups did so because algorithms steered them there. In an increasingly interconnected world where people are surrounded by smart devices that collect their data 24&#x2F;7, data ownership and control has never been more important than anything else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Bitcoin, many cryptocurrencies have rallied the movement of decentralization, but only a handful hold technology that can bring true impact. What if there was one project out there that could apply the peer-to-peer and open-source fundamentals to the Internet? ThreeFold spent the last six years developing a new Internet infrastructure from the ground up consisting of a new decentralized operating system, a quantum safe storage system, a planetary mesh network and a distributed edge cloud solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold builds on 20+ years of technological innovations in the cloud automation, Internet storage and cybersecurity markets brought by its co-founders such as Kristof de Spiegeleer ‚Äì a serial entrepreneur whose technologies have been acquired by Oracle, Verizon, Data Symantec and others. Together, the ThreeFold co-founders decided to start from scratch as they realized it was the only way to achieve a peer-to-peer and open-source digital backbone that secure, private and self-sovereign.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to de Spiegeleer, ‚ÄúThreeFold holds more technology than all the Web3 space combined.‚Äù ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized operating system can run on any computer, including servers, desktops and laptops, allowing anyone to connect hardware from their home or office to the peer-to-peer Internet.‚Äú&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what differentiates ThreeFold the most from the crowd is that it‚Äôs a project anchored in it‚Äôs values and vision. The project always remained far from fake hype, market making or FOMO games like the large majority of crypto projects. With a low market cap today, and its ability to transform the Internet at large, the time to buy &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is now. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on the verge of signing our first countries and also have use cases across Real Estate, Education, Supply Chain, Metaverse and Blockchain coming up this year,‚Äù said de Spiegeleer, ‚ÄúSo, we believe we are looking at tens of millions of users on ThreeFold in the upcoming years.‚Äú&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>Paradise Hills Property Development and ThreeFold to Establish the World‚Äôs First Neighborhood Cloud in Dubai</title>
		<published>2022-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates | Real Estate developer Paradise Hills and ThreeFold have announced today their plans to add dedicated servers (3Nodes) to approximately 170 homes in the Paradise Hill project, creating the world‚Äôs first neighborhood Cloud Network on the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this historic partnership, Paradise Hills Development and ThreeFold aim to provide every homeowner of the gated residence with a pre-installed 3Node, a dedicated server that provides the edge computing and internet storage needed to run decentralized applications and internet services. The initiative will provide residents, businesses, developers and the government with a secure and highly available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;3nodehands.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3Node&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúParadise Hills is set to become the region‚Äôs center for true decentralization and the future of tomorrow‚Äôs Internet, essentially setting the standard for real estate developments and homeownership globally,‚Äù CEO Shaher Mousli of Paradise Hills Development said about the partnership.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis historic collaboration is the first pilot in a series of initiatives by ThreeFold to help expand the digital landscape of the United Arab Emirates (UAE),‚Äù says Adnan Fatayerji, co-founder of ThreeFold. ‚ÄúIt will support the development of edge computing, smart cities and IoT, showcasing the power of the private sector to build and drive digital empowerment initiatives in support of the Digital Dubai vision set by the Emirates leadership.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, ‚Äúdata sovereignty‚Äù became a key topic globally, with many countries insisting that any data produced locally should be stored on Internet infrastructures within their borders. By bringing ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized Internet infrastructure to real estate properties such as Paradise Hills, the UAE will be home to the first-of-its-kind, self-sovereign, smart city development in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThrough simple, secure, and scalable technology, ThreeFold empowers millions to invent and explore new experiences,‚Äù added ThreeFold co-founder Kristof de Spiegeleer. ‚ÄúWe want to empower local businesses, creators, and communities to build a more sustainable and inclusive future.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You and your communities can participate in the expansion and interconnection of the decentralized Internet as well!

		<title>Can a &#x27;Democratized&#x27; Internet exist in times of a Cyber War?</title>
		<published>2022-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/cyberwar/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On February 24 2022, Russia launched a large-scale military invasion and attack on Ukraine. In the days since the invasion began, the war has been fought not only on the ground and in the air, but also in the digital realm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber warfare is nothing new, especially in Russia and Eastern Europe. ‚ÄúIn the relatively short and rapidly evolving history of cyber conflict, perhaps nothing has been established with greater certainty and more widely accepted than the idea that Russia has significant cyber capabilities and isn‚Äôt afraid to use them,‚Äù &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;6153902&#x2F;russia-major-cyber-attacks-invasion-ukraine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;writes Josephine Wolff&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tufts University. ‚ÄúEspecially on Ukraine.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to the invasion, Ukraine experienced a series of cyberattacks on its critical infrastructures, including banks and government agencies. On February 23 2022, just a day before the launch of Russia‚Äôs military attack, websites of the Ukrainian parliament and multiple government agencies were put out of work. Similar cyber attacks had also been seen in early February and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;europe&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;23&#x2F;will-war-in-ukraine-lead-to-a-wider-cyber-conflict?utm_campaign=a.io&amp;amp;utm_medium=audio.podcast.np&amp;amp;utm_source=babbage&amp;amp;utm_content=discovery.content.anonymous.tr_shownotes_na-na_article&amp;amp;utm_term=sa.listeners&quot;&gt;were attributed to GRU&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Russia‚Äôs military-intelligence agency. And Ukrainian cities continue to suffer from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;graphic-detail&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;26&#x2F;ukrainian-cities-are-suffering-internet-blackouts?utm_campaign=a.io&amp;amp;utm_medium=audio.podcast.np&amp;amp;utm_source=babbage&amp;amp;utm_content=discovery.content.anonymous.tr_shownotes_na-na_article&amp;amp;utm_term=sa.listeners&quot;&gt;internet blackouts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. On Sunday, Ukraine‚Äôs vice president even called for tech specialists and hackers to join the ‚Äúcyber front.‚Äù While the predictions of a Russian ‚Äúcyber onslaught‚Äù have not necessarily come true yet, both sides have engaged in cyber attacks on visible and invisible levels.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-rise-in-state-sponsored-cyber-attacks-globally&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-rise-in-state-sponsored-cyber-attacks-globally&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-rise-in-state-sponsored-cyber-attacks-globally&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A Rise in State-Sponsored Cyber Attacks Globally&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital or cyber warfare does not just apply to Russia and Ukraine. Broadly, cybersecurity experts have been raising concerns in recent years amid a sharp rise in ransomware and other types of digital attacks globally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Meyers, Senior Vice President of Intelligence at the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marketplace.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;24&#x2F;cybersecurity-to-take-center-stage-as-conflict-continues-in-ukraine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;said&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: ‚ÄúJust in the last year, I think we‚Äôve seen over 2,700 big-game hunting attacks [cyberattacks that target high-value data]. So they‚Äôre far and away that most prevalent actor. Nation-state actors are continuously operating as well, but they tend to operate a little bit more under the radar. They don‚Äôt conduct as many widespread and widely known attacks. They try to, obviously, steal information without it being identified that they‚Äôve stolen it.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these are just the most current examples ‚Äì Russia is hardly the only country engaging in cyber warfare at a larger scale. In fact, it is becoming increasingly difficult for governments, corporations and organizations to protect themselves against cyber attacks, especially against &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2022&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;companies-have-a-lot-to-fear-from-russias-digital-warmongering?utm_campaign=a.io&amp;amp;utm_medium=audio.podcast.np&amp;amp;utm_source=babbage&amp;amp;utm_content=discovery.content.anonymous.tr_shownotes_na-na_article&amp;amp;utm_term=sa.listeners&quot;&gt;state-sponsored attacks&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And in the digital space, the best and most dangerous hacks are those that go unnoticed until it‚Äôs too late.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-governments-are-sectioning-off-the-internet-through-digital-borders&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#some-governments-are-sectioning-off-the-internet-through-digital-borders&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: some-governments-are-sectioning-off-the-internet-through-digital-borders&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Some Governments are Sectioning Off the Internet Through Digital Borders&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A set of countries like Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have certain &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codastory.com&#x2F;authoritarian-tech&#x2F;global-rise-internet-sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;aspirations for the internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Domestically, these countries want control and think governments should get to decide what information flows across their borders. Globally, they want governments, not companies and NGOs, to be in charge of the internet. While some may say that government-owned internet infrastructures would be the only way to protect a country‚Äôs sovereignty, it goes without saying that what once was a neutral space for humanity to connect and exchange information is turning into a political schema.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these goals are an attempt to align cyberspace with national borders, so they are sometimes dubbed the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codastory.com&#x2F;authoritarian-tech&#x2F;global-rise-internet-sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;‚Äúcyber sovereignty‚Äù doctrine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The term comes from China, whose internet censorship system, called the Great Firewall, is the vanguard of the global cyber-sovereignty push. China‚Äôs cyberspace agency released a much-ridiculed musical ode to cybersecurity under Lu Wei‚Äôs leadership, which included the line: ‚ÄúA cyberpower: Where the Internet is, so is the glorious dream.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of effective cyber-sovereignty is expanding to new horizons. A November &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.codastory.com&#x2F;authoritarian-tech&#x2F;global-rise-internet-sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;report&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from Freedom House examined 65 countries and found since the previous year that internet freedom declined in 26 of them. Chinese-style ‚Äúdigital authoritarianism,‚Äù meanwhile, is growing in influence as China exports both its surveillance known-how and technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that digital sovereignty is a major concept that not only addresses the issues of communication and connection but also the impact on societies and culture at large. With cyber sovereignty turning into a non-territorial challenge to sovereignty itself irrespective of the virtual realm of the internet, is there a way out for humanity?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-free-and-sovereign-cyber-space-is-needed&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-free-and-sovereign-cyber-space-is-needed&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-free-and-sovereign-cyber-space-is-needed&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A Free and Sovereign Cyber Space is Needed&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the current internet is facing some big challenges that have major implications for humanity. Data privacy and self-sovereignty is almost impossible today, raising serious questions towards those that control the Internet. But it also seems that these companies fell into the trap of their own business models and algorithms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking a step back, the world seems just a few years away from the Matrix, as depicted by the Wachowskis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is playing an incredibly important role for the most powerful intelligence companies. As depicted by Meyers, we wouldn‚Äôt even notice that our information is being stolen all the time to benefit the greed of powerful geo-political actors. The internet is not a public good anymore, and unless humanity reacts fast, it may be that the world will lose all forms of freedom or sovereignty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;cyberspace-independence&quot;&gt;‚ÄúA declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by John Perry Barlow once attempted to shed light on the applicability of government and institutions on the rapidly growing internet, already in 1996 trying to protect its neutrality. According to research, the world is experiencing innovation at an increasingly rapid pace. With the rise of blockchains and web3 technology, could the dream of John Perry Barlow turn into reality?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world aching for more decentralization and less dependence on governments and corporations, new decentralized and peer-to-peer models are already proving to be more resilient and secure. New Internet infrastructure companies such as ThreeFold have successfully built peer-to-peer internet infrastructures that are more resilient than the current centralized model. On such systems, people and enterprises can store their data and run their applications on a distributed network of computers in such a way that their data cannot be corrupted. ThreeFold even created a so-called ‚Äúquantum safe‚Äù storage that guarantees that even the most powerful computers in the world wouldn‚Äôt be able to reconstruct user data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalation of this cyber conflict can lead to unforeseen consequences and casualties. That is why it is especially important that our industry works together to protect customers, partners, employees and citizens. ThreeFold is on a mission to realize the promise of a fully-comprehensive, open-source and peer-to-peer internet infrastructure. ThreeFold is a platform for the creators of tomorrow to build that blueprint of responsibility and ensure that the outcome of future systems is neutrality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;Br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>Building a New Internet From the Ground Up ‚Äì Part 4: Network</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After introducing the ThreeFold Grid in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and diving deep into &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_pt2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;compute&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we‚Äôre back with part 4 to look at the networking aspects of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer networking is a rather complex phenomenon with a thankfully intuitive outcome: you send messages from one place to another. We all understand that our digital devices become a lot less interesting when they are not connected to the Internet. However, networking is not just Internet, and when it comes to building a new Internet, it‚Äôs important to understand what that means.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing Internet can be defined as a global set of networks and protocols that enable us to do things like load web pages and use apps that rely on external data. It depends on lots of underlying infrastructure, including fiber optic cables running along the ocean floor, our home routers and their connection to an Internet service provider (ISP), lots of cell service towers, and an increasing number of satellites. All of that makes the Internet possible, and it‚Äôs still required for a new Internet to function.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; uses and builds new protocols to create a network that is interoperable with the existing Internet. These include private overlay networks, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on Yggdrasil, and various interfaces to the public Internet. Let‚Äôs see how they work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-overlay-networks&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#private-overlay-networks&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: private-overlay-networks&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Private overlay networks&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every deployment on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_primitives?id=network-uses-nu&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; belongs to a network, which is one of the Grid primitives. These networks allow data to be transmitted between workloads in a private and secure manner. They are called overlay networks because they pass traffic over some underlying network. That could be within a single node or between nodes on infrastructure provided by a farmer. The Grid uses software called WireGuard for this purpose, a simple, fast, and secure option among its alternatives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By means of encryption, the traffic on a private overlay network is unreadable to any other device on that network. Likewise, the workloads within the private network have no visibility of the underlying network. Individuals who deploy workloads can access their networks over a secure tunnel, assuming that one of the nodes in the network is reachable from the public Internet. This is suitable for workload administration and some private applications. For public services and peer-to-peer communication, the ThreeFold Grid provides other solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;planetary-network&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#planetary-network&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: planetary-network&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__planetary_network?id=planetary-network&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an implementation of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yggdrasil-network.github.io&#x2F;about.html&quot;&gt;Yggdrasil Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is a next generation approach to network routing. It is a peer-to-peer solution where all traffic is encrypted and takes the shortest path to its destination. These features make it highly compatible with the ethos and goals of the ThreeFold Grid: privacy, security, and efficiency. The design also allows nodes, workloads, and users to communicate freely without relying on centralized intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro?id=threefold-farming&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; connect their nodes to a home router which blocks all inbound traffic by default. This is a sensible feature that doesn‚Äôt interfere with most Internet usage (enthusiasts who want to host their own website or a gaming server might bypass this, for example). However, nodes on the Grid need to be reachable, especially in order to receive workload definitions from deployers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planetary Network solves this by accepting inbound traffic through an outbound connection to a publicly accessible peer. You can think of this like making a call to an operator and then waiting for another call to be routed to you on that line. Even if your phone is set to block all incoming calls, someone can still reach you if they can reach the operator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also provides a way for workloads to communicate with one another and be reachable by users. Anyone can enable the Planetary Network on their own device to access sites and services in a very &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;secure and private&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; way. While the ThreeFold Grid is designed to be fully interoperable with the existing Internet, the Planetary Network provides an alternative which can sit side by side in a seamless way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;reliable-message-bus&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#reliable-message-bus&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: reliable-message-bus&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Reliable Message Bus&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Planetary Network, nodes and Grid users can send messages over the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;manual__rmd&quot;&gt;Reliable Message Bus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Notably, it is used for the delivery of workload definitions as mentioned earlier. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; supports some other RMB messages as well, for doing things like checking available capacity on a node in real time. RMB is a general purpose protocol that can be used by developers in their applications. It queries the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a kind of address book for the Planetary Network, enabling nodes and users to find each other in a decentralized way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-ips-and-web-gateways&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#public-ips-and-web-gateways&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: public-ips-and-web-gateways&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Public IPs and Web Gateways&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let‚Äôs see how the Grid can offer services over the public Internet using public IP addresses and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;web-gateway&#x2F;&quot;&gt;web gateways&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Everytime we type a domain name into our browser, like threefold.io, it is resolved to an IP address. The browser then forms a connection with that address to retrieve the site we‚Äôre looking for. Reviving a theme from earlier, that IP must be publicly reachable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-ips&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#public-ips&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: public-ips&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Public IPs&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre in the midst of a shift from the older IPv4 standard to the newer IPv6 standard. While IPv6 has plenty of addresses for every device on the planet and many more, it hasn‚Äôt been universally adopted yet, and IPv4 addresses are in short supply. You likely have one assigned to your router at home, and these days, even getting a second one from your ISP can be a difficult and expensive proposition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid allows farmers who own blocks of IPv4 addresses to rent them out to deployers. These addresses get attached to individual workloads which are then reachable over the public Internet. A deployer could then assign their own domain name to that IP and host a website there. This is a very flexible way to make Grid deployments publicly available, but it comes at a relatively high cost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-gateways&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#web-gateways&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: web-gateways&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Web Gateways&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__webgw&quot;&gt;Web gateways&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are another way to make workloads on the ThreeFold Grid available over the public Internet. In this case, the farmer may provide a domain name that points to one of their nodes which is publicly reachable. Deployers are then able to reserve a subdomain, like explorer.threefold.io is a subdomain of threefold.io, that routes traffic to their workload. It is also possible for a deployer to point their own domain to the gateway node which then routes traffic to the appropriate workloads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We glossed over a bit in the earlier description of domain name to IP address resolution. In fact, multiple domains can point to a single IP address and this is common practice among existing web hosts. Adding similar functionality to the Grid helps to ease the demand for IPv4 addresses and is a lower cost solution for deployers than renting a dedicated IP. The web gateway also serves to enhance security and reliability of Grid-hosted services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gateway provides a connection from the public Internet to the secure private overlay networks that all workloads use. However, this is not a standard network connection but instead a network socket, which provides security through separation. This is something like passing along the contents of mail pieces without their envelopes. Web gateways also enable redundancy, as multiple gateways can point to the same workload, and multiple workloads can serve the same set of gateways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say the ThreeFold Grid scales limitlessly, this is one of the ways that‚Äôs true. Many nodes, many gateways, many applications, and many users can all fit into this model. Deployers can start with a single &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__weblets_vm?id=virtual-machine&quot;&gt;virtual machine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and a single public IP like in the example I‚Äôll use to wrap up this piece below, then ramp up to a globally distributed and highly redundant system as their requirements grow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;send-receive-complete&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#send-receive-complete&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: send-receive-complete&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Send, receive, complete&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we‚Äôve seen how the ThreeFold Grid handles networking. From private and secure communication between workloads, to next generation &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; communication and full compatibility with the existing Internet, these offerings are comprehensive. Not only that, but they can be pretty darn fun to play with too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own recent experience, I deployed a virtual machine on the Grid with a public IP and hosted a simple website with a map of nodes on the Grid that I‚Äôd been working on. I was able to quickly share it with some colleagues and members of the community. It went from a project I was tinkering with on my own computer to a live site on the Internet in a matter of minutes, thanks especially to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tf-deep-dive-session-5-threefold-grid-architecture&#x2F;1756&quot;&gt;networking features&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final piece of this series, we‚Äôll see how everything comes together to turn computer code into a meaningful digital experience. Stay tuned!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to switch between blockchains? Cross-chain bridges allow you to easily transfer TFT from one blockchain to another.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__threefold_grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 3.0, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has been available on three blockchains ‚Äì Stellar, Binance Smart Chain and the Substrate-based ThreeFold Blockchain (aka TF Chain).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already active bridges that connect Stellar to Binance Smart Chain and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, improving the accessibility and availability of TFT, while also connecting the ThreeFold ecosystem to external blockchain networks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about TF Chain in our blog post &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-bridges-and-why-are-they-important&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-bridges-and-why-are-they-important&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-are-bridges-and-why-are-they-important&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What are bridges and why are they important?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of bridges in crypto is similar to a bridge in the physical world. Bridges in the real world simply connect two different locations and communities so that the people can travel back and forth and resources can be exchanged freely.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, using bridges in blockchain allows users to easily transfer tokens and other crypto assets between two or more networks ‚Äì regardless of the different protocols, tooling, and governance models these networks have. Simply put, a bridge ensures a secure interoperability between different blockchains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold uses blockchain bridges to connect external blockchain networks to the ThreeFold ecosystem. The bridging mechanisms we‚Äôve implemented allow TFT to be transferred securely between &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__money_blockchain_partity_link&quot;&gt;different blockchains&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Currently, we‚Äôve established &lt;strong&gt;two 2-way bridges&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Binance Smart Chain&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar &amp;lt;&amp;gt; TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is the difference between the 3 chains?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;?locale=en&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is an open-source network for storing and moving digital assets, and still remains the main blockchain for the minting of TFT and distribution of farming rewards. Until the launch of TF Chain with Grid 3.0, only TFT living on Stellar were accepted for the reservation of Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.binance.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;smartChain&quot;&gt;Binance Smart Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (BSC) is a standalone, parallel Binance chain that is a leading DeFi ecosystem next to Ethereum. On BSC, TFT is implemented as a cross-chain asset, allowing anyone to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bridge.bsc.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;connect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to the bridge using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_bsc_metamask&quot;&gt;Metamask&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__threefold_wallets?id=the-threefold-connect-app&quot;&gt;Trust Wallet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì the most popular Web 3 wallets in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was built on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substrate.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Substrate framework&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with the purpose of decentralizing user-farmer relationships on the ThreeFold Grid. It has its own native form of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which can be bridged back and forth from Stellar-based TFT. This model will be implemented for other chains in the future, for interoperability and cross-chain features between blockchain and DeFi ecosystems and the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-new-with-tf-chain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-s-new-with-tf-chain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-s-new-with-tf-chain&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What‚Äôs new with TF Chain?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TF Chain represents a leap forward for simplicity in payments for capacity reservations and a move towards greater decentralization of the systems that support the ThreeFold Grid. With the launch of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-new-in-tfgrid-3-0&#x2F;1133&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid 3.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, TF Chain became the official record of ThreeFold farms and nodes, and brought peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;billing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on smart contracts for workload deployments on the ThreeFold Grid.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, minting will remain on Stellar but reservations of nodes and capacity on ThreeFold Grid 3.0 are already executed via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Bridges were established between Stellar and TF Chain to facilitate payments, e.g. if you pay for a workload deployment in Stellar TFT, this payment needs to be bridged to TF¬† Chain‚Äôs native TFT to fund the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__smartcontract_it&quot;&gt;smart contract&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-two-way-bridge-between-stellar-bsc&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-two-way-bridge-between-stellar-bsc&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-two-way-bridge-between-stellar-bsc&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The two-way &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bridge.bsc.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bridge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between Stellar &amp;amp; BSC¬†&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the bridge between Stellar and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was one-way only: from BSC to Stellar. Even though it was possible to transfer TFT from Stellar to BSC via¬† &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldfoundation&#x2F;tft&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;bsc&#x2F;bridges&#x2F;stellar&#x2F;transfers.md&quot;&gt;command line&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this was only an option for tech-savvy people. Now, you can also deposit TFT from Stellar to BSC using the bridge with a proper UI, as you can see in the image below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tft_bsc_bridge.png&quot; alt=&quot;tft_bsc_bridge&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When depositing from TFT Stellar, &lt;strong&gt;please be sure that both addresses and memo are as indicated&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in the instructions or the TFT you transfer will be lost forever. To facilitate the process, a &lt;strong&gt;QR code&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is generated and can be scanned using the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__threefold_connect&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Connect app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, automatically filling in the right address and memo on your behalf.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ThreeFold ecosystem continues to grow, we‚Äôre looking into building more bridges (e.g. Cosmos, Ethereum) to improve the accessibility of TFT and simplify the onboarding of blockchain and DeFi projects on the ThreeFold Grid. TF Chain will play an important role in the further development of the People‚Äôs Internet, so give our blog post on TF Chain a read &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was an important year for ThreeFold, with huge developments on the ThreeFold Grid, the continued expansion of the grid by farmers, key partnerships, and more ‚Äì all setting up for a strong 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs take a quick look back at the year that was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-grid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January we launched ThreeFold Grid 2.4 on Mainnet and evolved it through version 2.8. In September, we launched ThreeFold Grid 3.0 on testnet and just this week, we launched TF Grid 3.0 on mainnet, with limited capacity for now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold Grid 3 brings a massive leap forward in the decentralization of the ThreeFold Grid and makes for a much simpler user experience for farmers and grid users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting point ThreeFold Grid 3:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2021 was all about bringing TFT to more chains and making TFT more accessible, with the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;bsc_update_news&#x2F;&quot;&gt;BSC integration&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, TF Chain, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;tft_1inch&#x2F;&quot;&gt;1inch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, we introduced a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__certified_farming&quot;&gt;certified farming program&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;farming rewards 3.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which will apply from ThreeFold Grid 3.1 onwards (end Jan). We also established &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;farming&#x2F;nodeshop-pre-order-faq&#x2F;59&quot;&gt;weekly 3Node updates&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to keep you in the loop at all times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2021, we announced key partnerships with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;owncloud_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ownCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;digithree&#x2F;&quot;&gt;DigiThree Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;threefold_casperlabs&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CasperLabs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and many more. Most recently, two of these partnerships were featured in the news, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;martechseries.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold-and-take-action-global-partner-to-bring-internet-access-to-1-billion-people-across-the-globe&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TAG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;2021-12-21&#x2F;helping-africa-go-digital-a-metaverse-startup-is-working-with-an-ngo-to-expand-digital-infrastructure-in-africa&quot;&gt;Computecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, our goal for the ThreeFold Token is to be available at as many entry points as possible. We‚Äôre planning integrations with many ecosystems like Cosmos to achieve great networking effects for the money networks. There will be discounts for Utilization based on pre-purchasing of TFT, and more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no other project out there like ThreeFold. TF Grid 3 is here, the grid is continuously growing across the world, and this collective effort is uniquely positioned to truly decentralize the Internet. Remember: ThreeFold is inevitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here we go! You can expect many more updates soon on what was covered above. And may the year 2022 be full of health, happiness and opportunities for all of us!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be reminded we are a decentralized movement, we need your help to let us all ‚ÄúBE THE INTERNET.‚Äù Become a farmer, register for a validator, contribute to our movement, develop a solution on top of TF Grid ‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre not sure how to help out but want to, please get in touch on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;our two-way chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or here on the forum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Built on the Substrate framework, TF Chain represents the layer-0 for all current and future technologies to provision decentralized Internet capacity.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is Substrate to begin with? And what exactly does our TF Chain do?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-tf-chain-and-what-is-substrate&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-tf-chain-and-what-is-substrate&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-tf-chain-and-what-is-substrate&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is TF Chain and what is Substrate?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the universal smart contract layer on the ThreeFold Grid. It‚Äôs an application-specific blockchain customized for the operation of a single application ‚Äì provisioning decentralized compute, storage and network capacity.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substrate.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Substrate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a blockchain-building framework from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parity.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Parity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that allows developers to simply create future-proof solo blockchains or parachains for any use case. Parity was founded by Ethereum‚Äôs co-founder and first CTO Gavin Wood in 2015, and went on to develop Substrate to power a multichain, interoperable and decentralized Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-we-choose-substrate-for-our-tf-chain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-did-we-choose-substrate-for-our-tf-chain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-did-we-choose-substrate-for-our-tf-chain&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why did we choose Substrate for our TF Chain?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substrate brings clear benefits to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in relation to its frameworks for developers, its interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems and its huge community. More than 150 projects from NFTs to DeFi are already building on it.¬†¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a solid, mature and secure layer for custom blockchains, Substrate is built for adoption. The blockchain framework was built with the programming language Rust and is modular by design. Choosing Substrate allowed our developer team to leverage great blockchain constructs and efficiently build TF Chain instead of re-inventing the wheel.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its flexible, modular and composable architecture enables our team to focus on what matters the most ‚Äì the unique demands of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For example, we‚Äôve built¬† a Grid module with specific functionalities for farms and nodes. Just like a chef can invent a new recipe and add it to a menu, Substrate allows our developers to build and add as many custom functionalities to TF Chain as we‚Äôd like, in a fully decentralized way.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major benefit that comes with TF Chain being built on Substrate is the native compatibility with the Polkadot ecosystem, opening up the opportunity for ThreeFold to become a parachain on the Polkadot network and seamlessly bridging to other Substrate-based chains in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-the-purpose-of-tf-chain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-s-the-purpose-of-tf-chain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-s-the-purpose-of-tf-chain&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What‚Äôs the purpose of TF Chain?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ThreeFold to be a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;quest_decentralize_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;truly decentralized&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure, people should be able to use Internet infrastructures from anywhere without any intermediaries like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. TF Chain serves exactly that purpose.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It orchestrates the provisioning of compute, storage and network on the ThreeFold Grid via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, removing all forms of intermediaries present in today‚Äôs centralized IT infrastructures. Put simply, TF Chain allows people to provide and use cloud resources in a 100% decentralized way.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-tf-chain-do&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-tf-chain-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-tf-chain-do&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What does TF Chain do?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is responsible for achieving consensus on all Internet capacity transactions on the ThreeFold Grid and to store them in a historical record. This prevents users from ‚Äúdouble spending‚Äù their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and ensures the correct execution of Internet capacity provisioning via smart contracts, while also protecting the network from potential attacks.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting feature that comes with TF Chain 3.0 is a totally new peer-to-peer billing framework for Internet capacity provisioning and workload deployment. This module allows for all functionalities of the ThreeFold Grid to be provisioned peer-to-peer between users and farmers. Therefore, the ThreeFold Token now also lives on the Polkadot network, allowing it to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bridges_connecting_threefold_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bridge back and forth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the Stellar network and potentially from other chains in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TF Chain builds on the Substrate framework, most of its functionalities are custom-built to fit the specific needs of the ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì from Internet capacity provisioning, workload deployments, and payment and billing processes, to digital twin creation and much more. By executing all these actions via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in an automated and decentralized way, the activity on the ThreeFold Grid is always secured by blockchain technology and available to other users for open collaboration.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Farms can now be registered on our new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech_update_admin_portal&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TF Chain Portal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Internet capacity provisioning and workload deployments are already executed via TF Chain, the minting of TFT according to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_capacity&quot;&gt;Proof-of-Capacity algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; remains on the Stellar blockchain for now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building our own application-specific blockchain represents a major step towards decentralizing the ThreeFold Grid and ecosystem ‚Äì a &lt;strong&gt;massive thank you&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to our developer team for this great achievement! üôè&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The ThreeFold Grid 3.x Explorer UI</title>
		<published>2021-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-11-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-update-explorer-interface/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to present to you the new Explorer UI for ThreeFold Grid 3.x! üéâ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Explorer was designed to provide &lt;strong&gt;a simple way for anyone to find decentralized Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and we‚Äôre thrilled to announce a new user interface for Grid 3.x on both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.test.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;testnet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.dev.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;devnet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new explorer builds upon the recent migration to the Parity Substrate, &lt;strong&gt;bringing true decentralization&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to the way compute, storage and network capacity information is sourced from 3Nodes. The previous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;explorer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (used for 2.x) has been sourcing its information from a centralized database as TF Chain was still under construction. Now, the new explorer receives its information via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__explorer_graphql_intro&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;straight from the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__grid3_tfchain_init&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockhain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-graphql&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-graphql&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-graphql&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is GraphQL?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphql.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open source data query language for APIs. The GraphQL interface queries our blockchain and displays the information registered on it in a command-line interface. We, in turn, created a graphical representation of that information in our explorer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-expect-from-the-new-explorer-ui&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-to-expect-from-the-new-explorer-ui&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-to-expect-from-the-new-explorer-ui&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What to expect from the new Explorer UI&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__explorer_home&quot;&gt;Explorer UI&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; allows you to &lt;strong&gt;explore the available Internet capacity&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; connected to ThreeFold Grid &lt;strong&gt;easier than ever before&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. As of now, the new Explorer displays data about the compute, storage, network and gateways connected to the Grid 3.x testnet and devnet by ThreeFold Farmers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistics section gives you &lt;strong&gt;an overview of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.test.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;key information&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; about our testnet (as of November 30th, 2021) as displayed below. Our farmer community has already connected &lt;strong&gt;more than 100 nodes (across 16 countries)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and we have seen &lt;strong&gt;more than 1,400 contracts deployed&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; on the ThreeFold Grid 3.0 testnet since its launch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_explorer_statistics.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_explorer_statistics&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All screenshots in this post are from the ThreeFold Grid 3.x testnet Explorer, and the numbers are growing continuously.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a farm ID gets registered to &lt;strong&gt;the new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfchain_portal_home&quot;&gt;TF Chain Portal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, all the relevant information (e.g. uptime, nodes specifications, location) of farms are automatically displayed on the Explorer for users to find their ideal decentralized Internet capacity. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can now explore all farms and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&#x2F;&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;multiple filtering options&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (e.g. farm name or farm ID), making it simpler than ever before to find the decentralized Internet capacity they are looking for. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the new Admin Portal is about? We‚Äôve covered all the details in &lt;strong&gt;our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-the-tf-chain-admin-portal-for-farmers-and-grid-users&#x2F;1526&quot;&gt;previous update&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, check it out!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made the world map bigger to improve the display of the available decentralized Internet capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The updated Explorer brings a simple interface and true decentralization to the way compute, storage, and network capacity information is sourced from 3Nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to our farmer community for already connecting more than 100 nodes (across 16 countries) to testnet.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And to our testing community ‚Äì more than 1,400 contracts have been deployed since testnet launch!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; üöÄ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Introducing the TF (Chain) Admin Portal ‚Äì for farmers and grid users!</title>
		<published>2021-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-update-admin-portal/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we shared an update on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-new-in-tf-grid-3-0-1-and-the-path-to-mainnet&#x2F;1488&quot;&gt;what‚Äôs new in TF Grid 3.0.1 ‚Äì and the path to mainnet!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; There‚Äôs been a lot of exciting progress by the team, and we wanted to share with you some more specifics where we can ‚Äì starting with the admin portal!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-admin-portal&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-the-admin-portal&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-the-admin-portal&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is the admin portal?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the requests from farmers and grid users was a to have a simpler user experience. The admin portal (aka TF Chain UI) is a response to that feedback, a graphical user interface for farmers and grid users on top of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;the TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The admin portal is the starting point for anyone to start working with the TF Grid.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; For Farmers in particular they now have a much simpler way to create a farming identity and then connect their infrastructure to the ThreeFold Grid 3.0. It is a one stop shop to start a farm. Beyond that, it‚Äôs a way for any TF Grid user to create their account on the TF Chain, get a Twin, and get started (testing for now) on the TF Grid 3.0 devnet or testnet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find links to get started at the bottom!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-the-admin-portal-do&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-the-admin-portal-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-the-admin-portal-do&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What does the admin portal do?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The admin portal is a place for TF Grid users to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an account on the TF Chain and a digital twin to start smart contracting on TF Chain (allowing you to also link to your IP address for added security).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_ui.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_ui&quot; &#x2F;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operate a bridge between Stellar and TF Chain on Parity Substrate (deposit TFT from Stellar, or return unused TFT to the Stellar chain, the bridge is active in both directions)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_deposit.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_deposit&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_withdraw.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_withdraw&quot; &#x2F;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For farmers: create and manage your farm(s), provide IPv4 addresses available for your farm(s), attach a Stellar wallet for TFT payouts, and a link to download the bootloader for testnet and devnet (mainnet is on its way).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_your_farm.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_your_farm&quot; &#x2F;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portal also links to the new capacity explorer, which we‚Äôll share more about early next week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_node_resources.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_node_resources&quot; &#x2F;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-is-this-an-improvement-over-the-old-process&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-is-this-an-improvement-over-the-old-process&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-is-this-an-improvement-over-the-old-process&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How is this an improvement over the old process?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, all of these tools existed, but not always in the same place or with a clear and easy-to-use UX&#x2F;UI. We‚Äôve tested this portal with people of all technical levels, and the response has been great! We believe the portal is a huge step forward for anyone using or managing the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More improvements will come in the next versions. As an example, we‚Äôre planning for you to be able to see the connected nodes linked to your farm with their status, earned tokens, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#get-started&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: get-started&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Get started&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portal is currently available on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.dev.grid.tf&quot;&gt;devnet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;portal.test.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;testnet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. You can also find information on the portal in our library &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfgrid3_getstarted&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Please note, you‚Äôll need to install the Polkadot{.js} extension and create or import an account in order to get started.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/project-comparison-4-storj/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the fourth part of our journey through the decentralization space. After exploring &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dfinity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_2_akash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and most recently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_3_filecoin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we‚Äôll now explore Storj to find out what we have in common and where ThreeFold stands out. Here we go!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;storj-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#storj-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: storj-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Storj &amp;amp; how the project compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&quot;&gt;Storj&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a decentralized cloud storage (DCS) solution founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson, offering cloud object storage on its network of nodes and ISPs spread across different countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold and Storj are both open source projects that view transparency as an integral part of their business philosophy. Actually, ThreeFold is the first full-stack blockchain-enabled &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to be made open source ‚Äì all of our code is open source and available for everyone to review or use. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similarity is that security and privacy are crucial aspects of our projects. Both are private by design and believe it‚Äôs vital that every person has total &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;control and ownership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; over their data ‚Äì not even Storj or ThreeFold can access the data of users within their respective ecosystems, creating trustless environments. Storj provides security and privacy by encrypting the data by an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;overview&quot;&gt;Uplink client&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before it is uploaded to its DCS. The data is then split into pieces which are distributed across different nodes and ISPs connected to Storj‚Äôs cloud network. At ThreeFold, we‚Äôre creating an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;entirely secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer IT ecosystem that empowers users and gives them back control and ownership of their own data. We‚Äôre &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; across all dimensions of our solutions ‚Äì from our operating system Zero-OS to Quantum Safe File System (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;QSFS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;planetary-network&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Storj does not have its own operating system, we‚Äôve built our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from scratch. It allows servers to run autonomously and workloads to be hosted securely, preventing them from administrative exploits and errors. The self-driving and self-healing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zero_os_blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;features&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Zero-OS eliminate backdoors, reduce the hacking surface and remove the need for human involvement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects are compatible with certain IT tools and protocols. While Storj is  S3-compatible and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;integrations&quot;&gt;integrates&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a couple of developer tools like FileZilla or Fastly, ThreeFold is highly compatible with leading industry standards and tools from S3 to Docker containers, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;grid-utilization-plan-part-one&#x2F;1157&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and more. Moreover, ThreeFold can run anything that runs on Linux, allowing for a seamless migration of any digital workload, even from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;traditional cloud providers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; like Microsoft Azure or AWS. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difference between the projects is that Storj focuses on providing the storage layer for developers to build storage applications like Dropbox upon, rather than offering such services themselves, whereas our energy-efficient full stack &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; includes solutions like the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;marketplace&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Marketplace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of ready-made peer-to-peer applications that runs on our Edge Virtual Data Center (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;cloud#&#x2F;cloud__evdc&quot;&gt;eVDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Moreover, we‚Äôre working with innovative teams and developers to develop self-sovereign &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;interview_with_jimber&#x2F;&quot;&gt;alternatives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to commonly used applications (e.g. video conferencing, office tools).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-storage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#network-storage&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: network-storage&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Network &amp;amp; Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Storj‚Äôs decentralized network, uploaded data is automatically spread across nodes in different countries. The storage capacity on Storj‚Äôs network is increased whenever a new node is connected to it. There are roughly 9,6 Petabyte of data stored on Storj with nodes in more than 80 countries, whereas roughly 85 Petabyte of storage, compute, and network capacity are deployed on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Currently, the nodes connected to our Grid are spread over more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&quot;&gt;50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Storj only offers storage capacity, ThreeFold provides storage, compute, and network capacity. Moreover, our system is endlessly scaleable, whereas Storj‚Äôs scalability is limited as it does not empower people without technical skills to contribute and has more complex structures, such as its Satellite component which will be explained further down. We‚Äôre continuously extending our reach and our system is capable of seamlessly growing on demand, as it enables anyone to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;become a 3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on our ThreeFold Grid. Moreover, our self-driving and self-healing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is unique in the space and removes the need for monitoring and maintaining the nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage nodes on Storj are responsible for storing and returning data reliably. While Storj generally allows anyone with the excess capacity and bandwidth to run a node on its network, the project does not offer certified hardware. With Storj, anyone who wants to become a node operator has to build their own nodes which have to meet the specific hardware &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;node&#x2F;before-you-begin&#x2F;prerequisites&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Storj. At ThreeFold, our technology was designed to scale to anywhere electricity and bandwidth can be found to meet local digital infrastructure needs, to empower the unconnected and to drive our vision of an interconnected world. This is also why we‚Äôre working with certified hardware partners to provide &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.threefold.tech&#x2F;index.php?route=common&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;plug-and-play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 3Nodes. These 3Nodes enable even people without technical skills to join and contribute to what we like to call the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;People‚Äôs Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;we believe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that everyone should be given equal chances and that Internet access is a human right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the storage nodes, there are two other &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;overview&quot;&gt;main components&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Storj network: Uplink and Satellite. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;definitions&quot;&gt;Uplink&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is Storj‚Äôs umbrella term for any application that stores or retrieves data and encrypts, encodes, and coordinates data with other services. Storj‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;satellite&quot;&gt;Satellite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; consists of a set of storage node services like storage node reputation, data repair, billing and more. Storj users have to sign up for accounts on Satellites and pick a specific Satellite to trust. While any user could run their own Satellite in theory, Storj recommends users to create an account on a Satellite that is hosted by a third party like Storj Labs to reduce complexity. This approach, however, fosters centralization, whereas our peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartereum.com&#x2F;189750&#x2F;threefold-is-audaciously-building-a-new-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open system where anyone can provide and utilize cloud resources without any intermediaries. On top of that, we‚Äôve implemented cryptographically-secured deployment specifications, called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;Smart Contracts for IT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to ensure that workloads run as intended in a tamper-proof way, and allow systems to scale and heal autonomously without intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tokenomics-payment-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tokenomics-payment-methods&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tokenomics-payment-methods&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Tokenomics &amp;amp; Payment Methods&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects have native utility tokens. While the Storj token is an Ethereum-based token that represents a unit of storage capacity on the Storj network, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) can represent either a unit of compute, storage or network on the ThreeFold Grid. Some Storj community members &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.storj.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-elephant-in-the-room-where-is-the-storj-token-utility&#x2F;12452&quot;&gt;criticize&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a lack of utility of the Storj token, as storage capacity on Storj can be purchased and paid for not only in Storj token but also using fiat payment options like credit card or invoice. However, Storj themselves don‚Äôt see this as an issue and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;storj-token-balances-and-flows-report-q1-2021&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that the intention behind their tokens is to facilitate the provision and receipt of data storage and not to create a digital currency or any other kind of financial instrument. In contrast, our ThreeFold Tokens are the fuel for IT capacity, as they allow people to hold current and future cloud capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. Moreover, a limited supply of four billion ThreeFold Token has been set to keep the currency scarce, while the burning mechanism simultaneously ensures continuous rewards for current and future nodes. Find out more about our two algorithms, Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) and Proof-of-Utilization (PoU), in our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tokenomics&quot;&gt;tokenomics&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By connecting storage nodes to Storj‚Äôs network and providing storage capacity to others, node operators get rewarded with Storj tokens which they receive &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;storj-token-balances-and-flows-report-q2-2021&quot;&gt;from Storj Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a centralized payment operator, whereas ThreeFold Token are already rewarded upon the connection of capacity to our Grid. Moreover, storage capacity on Storj‚Äôs network can only be purchased with a subscription-based &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;pricing&quot;&gt;model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. With ThreeFold, anyone can become a farmer and be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;rewarded income&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the form of ThreeFold Tokens for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the Internet by contributing cloud capacity. ThreeFold Tokens incentivize an open and autonomous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; system free from any type of intermediary. We‚Äôre enabling anyone to become an independent farmer, as we believe in empowering people and that no single entity should have the power to control systems. Based on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which will be released on Testnet 3.0 soon, a new discount as well as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;billing model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be introduced. The latter will allow users to authorize &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to automatically deduct their wallets according to the capacity they use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we both share the same vision of a decentralized Internet. The biggest difference between Storj and ThreeFold is that Storj is focused on providing storage, whereas &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; does not only provide storage but also compute and network capacity. While Storj seeks to be the storage layer for the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;quest_decentralize_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;decentralized Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold provides the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;low-level primitives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; decentralized Internet: compute, storage and network. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we‚Äôre the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;largest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, most advanced peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure in the world and are expanding fast, some aspects of Storj‚Äôs storage network still function in a rather centralized manner, such as their payment model and Satellites. In addition to that, we‚Äôre providing the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. The project could therefore &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;benefit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from moving on top of our fully decentralized, highly energy-efficient and autonomous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Together, we could drive the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econotimes.com&#x2F;ThreeFold-DFINITY-and-the-race-to-Decentralize-the-Internet-1618367&quot;&gt;decentralization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of storage capacity all over the world. We believe in a world without boundaries, where people are able to share information, value and knowledge without limits nor intermediaries. To achieve this vision and to effect change at a large scale it takes collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee created the web server and browser in 1990. Back then, the web was of a free, rather decentralized nature in which no single entity was to control the access to it. With the client-server architecture of the web, however, centralization came about. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__why_intro?id=everyone-should-be-autonomous&quot;&gt;Nowadays&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the web as well as the Internet in general are highly centralized. There are only a few companies acting as gatekeepers to large parts of today‚Äôs Internet. The Internet as we know it is continuously &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;web-3-0-the-decentralised-web-promises-to-make-the-internet-free-again-113139&quot;&gt;struggling with issues&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; related to its centralized nature ‚Äì from censorship and attacks on net neutrality to manipulation attempts from companies with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;28&#x2F;who-owns-the-internet&quot;&gt;monopolistic power&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. These issues are systematic and major players like Amazon or Facebook are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techmonitor.ai&#x2F;boardroom&#x2F;power-of-tech-companies&quot;&gt;benefitting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the situation as it is. This business model is also highly reliant on centralized hyperscale &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data_leaks&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data centers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that also come with a whole set of issues, from their vulnerability and limited scalability to their extremely high energy consumption &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;and more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have become the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;product&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of a business model where companies offer their services in exchange for personal data ‚Äì in order to capitalize on and exploit the data, basically squeezing people out for their data like oranges for juice. In times where &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techradar.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;why-personal-data-exploitation-has-become-the-norm&quot;&gt;data exploitation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the norm, it makes sense that data is often referred to as digital oil or gold. Moreover, algorithms of social media platforms increasingly lead to content provoking controversy and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thereboot.com&#x2F;creating-decentralized-social-media-alternatives-to-facebook-and-twitter&#x2F;&quot;&gt;addictive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; engagement as this type of content tends to increase the time people spend on the platforms ‚Äì with shocking impacts like The Wall Street Journals‚Äô &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-facebook-files-11631713039&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚ÄúThe Facebook Files‚Äù and The New York Times‚Äô audio series &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;22&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;rabbit-hole-prologue.html&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; show.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these issues have strengthened the push towards decentralization, mainly associated with the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. However, many of the projects in the decentralized space still rely on centralized providers or structures to some degree. The second most-popular blockchain in the world, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;decentralize_blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, for example, has 60% of its nodes run on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;centralized cloud providers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with 25% of them running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_2_akash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a blockchain-based cloud computing platform, prevents unutilized capacity from centralized cloud computing services from going to waste. Leveraging this underutilized cloud capacity, however, also causes Akash to be highly dependent on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.orchid.com&#x2F;akash-networks-greg-osuri-on-decentralizing-cloud-computing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;centralized capacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dfinity‚Äôs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; platform for decentralized apps (dApps) is based on an ecosystem of independent data centers, which makes it rather centralized on an infrastructural level. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the previously mentioned projects are all seeking to push decentralization, they all have one thing in common: they rely on centralized structures or providers at least to some degree and therefore, are not fully decentralized yet. So, what does &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;decentralize_blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;true decentralization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; look like?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;mission&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to transform the Internet and Cloud and to create borderless opportunities for humanity. Therefore, we‚Äòre truly committed to decentralizing the infrastructure behind the Internet to scale current and future digital workloads. At Threefold, we‚Äôre building an entirely &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;new infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the ground up, starting with a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of new, neutral capacity and our operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zero_os_blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Our ThreeFold Grid, based on open-source &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, enables an autonomous, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and energy-efficient infrastructure that allows for unlimited scalability while remaining affordable. Our Grid is the largest and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;most advanced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; peer-to-peer infrastructure in the world, already available in more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and keeps expanding fast. With our energy-efficient full stack &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, uniting compute, storage, and network, we are much more comprehensive than other projects. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ThreeFold, we believe in giving power to the people by developing technologies that empower individuals, enable social participation, and foster collaboration. We‚Äôre enabling even people without technical skills to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;join the network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.threefold.tech&#x2F;index.php?route=common&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; offered through our certified hardware partners. The ThreeFold Grid is therefore &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;more inclusive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and allows any individual to participate. Our peer-to-peer nature removes the need of centralized servers and any type of intermediary, allowing applications and data to live closer to where they‚Äôre being utilized. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, we believe that no one but you should own your data. Our technology empowers every user to be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data sovereign&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, giving them full control over their own data by using a variety of innovative technologies, such as autonomous IT, blockchain, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; networking. This way, our technology is turning traditional IT upside down, enabling a data-sovereign Internet that gives users &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;control&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and ownership of their data in an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;entirely secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer IT ecosystem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, we provide the low-level primitives for a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;decentralized world&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, enabling any project to run on a fully decentralized, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and self-healing infrastructure. As we truly believe in collaboration to effect change at a large scale to fully decentralize the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;Internet and Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ecosystem keeps growing.

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-cloud-vs-centralized-providers-like-aws-azure/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we‚Äôve recently been exploring decentralized &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;projects&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to see where ThreeFold is in the space and where we stand out, we thought it‚Äôs a good time to also look into how we compare to traditional, centralized cloud providers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud market is a highly complex and competitive one, currently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.srgresearch.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly&quot;&gt;dominated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by the market leaders Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure who account for more than half of the worldwide cloud revenues. This centralized nature of today‚Äôs cloud as well as its hyper-scale data center model are the cause for various issues, ranging from the monopolistic power of the few big market players and vendor lock-in effects to the incredibly high energy consumption of data centers and the limited scalability of the current model. Moreover, traditional data centers are more prone to outages and cyber attacks. We believe the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; built by independent farmers around the globe and our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provide a solution to all of these issues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While centralized cloud providers do offer some benefits, such as robust feature sets and huge customer service teams, there are a few key and important differences we think any customer would care about:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest and most obvious difference. Today, big tech holds a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.srgresearch.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly&quot;&gt;monopoly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the Internet and Cloud markets, meaning they somehow became the gatekeepers of what was originally intended to be a distributed, neutral Internet. When using AWS or Google Cloud, the data is stored in centralized data centers owned by private corporations. These data centers are susceptible to hacking and outages that can take down massive chunks of the Internet. In this system, people have become products, as they exchange their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data_leaks&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for ‚Äúfree‚Äù online experiences. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, data is stored fully decentralized on the peer-to-peer ThreeFold Grid, where the physical hardware is owned by independent ThreeFold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the data is owned by as well as only accessible to the person(s) who put it there. So, hackers can‚Äôt get in and due to the decentralized nature of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, large-scale outages would be much less likely as well. Further, no organization or entity needs to be trusted and people are not treated as products ‚Äì with ThreeFold‚Äôs infrastructure, the Internet is owned &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;by the people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Limitless Scalability at the Edge&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lightweight operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes it possible and even easy to install a node close to where the data is being consumed. There is no need for large servers, nor for heavy power supply installations. Together with our hardware partners, we‚Äôre offering &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play functionalities, allowing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;anyone to participate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This makes our model infinitely scalable at the edge. Hyper-scale data centers are not able to provide these levels of scalability and edge benefits. In order to scale their operations, centralized cloud providers need to build more data centers and take care of the related maintenance which takes time and costs billions. The traditional data center model also isn‚Äôt well suited for the edge, as this requires flexibility and close proximity to the respective data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralized clouds are secure, but vulnerable. At ThreeFold, we pride ourselves on the levels of security we‚Äôre providing. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nature of our technology means end-to-end transmission of data between parties (with no middlemen). This is a big one: Nothing is being stored or copied in central servers. Moreover, ThreeFold‚Äôs self-driving and self-healing IT removes the need for human intervention and eliminates the many back doors present in current architecture. So, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;security issues&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; caused by human error and hacking possibilities both diminish greatly. In addition to that, there is the distributed storage algorithm which makes it nearly impossible for data to be lost. And much more. You can find more info on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or in this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#privacy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: privacy&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Privacy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;own your data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and nobody ‚Äì not even us ‚Äì can get access to it is key to making ThreeFold much more private than centralized cloud providers. On top of that, connections within our global overlay network, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, are peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the centralized cloud is quite expensive, whereas our ThreeFold P2P Cloud is much more cost-effective. Learn more about this in our cloud pricing comparison &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;threefold__cloud_pricing_compare&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While electricity for storing and transporting data, administration, human resources, and even gas (to transport physical data-holding devices) lead to a very high energy consumption, our dispersed storage model and peer-to-peer infrastructure allow for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_storage&quot;&gt;significant energy savings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. So, another big difference between ThreeFold and centralized cloud providers is that we‚Äôre up to 100x more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the combination of our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers with their hyper-scale data centers. From decentralization and infinite scalability at the edge to considerable energy savings and cost effectiveness as well as data privacy and security, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;our solution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has much more value to offer, while solving critical issues related to centralized clouds.

		<title>How ThreeFold Can Truly Decentralize Blockchain</title>
		<published>2021-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralize-blockchain/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralize-blockchain/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The topic of decentralization is commonly tied to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain doesn‚Äôt store any of its information in a central location, rather it is copied and spread across a network of computers. And the most popular name in the blockchain space, Bitcoin, was intended as an alternative payment system free of central control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many blockchains are facing the same challenge: How can they escape the monopolies of centralized cloud providers for their own workloads, as well as for the dApps built on top of them? The key question is, is a blockchain truly decentralized if it is being hosted on a centralized solution? We say: no.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example to illustrate this challenge is the fact that up to 60% of Ethereum (the world‚Äôs second most-popular blockchain) nodes run on centralized cloud providers and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;25% of them run on Amazon Web Services (AWS)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the topic is being addressed, it isn‚Äôt being solved at scale. The good news is that ThreeFold can play a large part in solving it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-blockchains-make-this-move&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-blockchains-make-this-move&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-blockchains-make-this-move&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why should blockchains make this move?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain movement, as mentioned, is very heavily tied to the movement around decentralization. Cryptocurrencies represent the move away from centralized banks as the authorities and gatekeepers around money ‚Äì just as ThreeFold and similar projects represent the move away from centralized clouds as the authorities and gatekeepers around data. The thing is, if blockchains are to rely on centralized cloud for hosting, they aren‚Äôt truly embodying decentralization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, many blockchains have chosen centralized cloud providers in the past because there wasn‚Äôt much of an alternative. But now, the Decentralized Cloud (DeCloud) movement has changed all of that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how some specific audiences can benefit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-node-operators&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#for-node-operators&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: for-node-operators&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;For Node Operators&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any full node or validator node can run on ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, making that particular Blockchain even more community-owned, and more decentralized from an IT&#x2F;cloud level. Any node operator can choose to run their nodes from any farmer location on the ThreeFold Grid, totally &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what_is_peer_to_peer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between the chosen farmer and the node operator. The deployed workloads are computed in a P2P manner, no middle party involved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-dapp-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#for-dapp-developers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: for-dapp-developers&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;For dApp Developers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web3&#x2F;Blockchain developers can use ThreeFold‚Äôs P2P Cloud - offering both compute and storage - to build and power their applications in a truly decentralized cloud infrastructure, both blockchain-native and cloud-native. A strong advantage here is that developers have the ability to leverage Kubernetes, Docker, S3, and other cloud-native tools (all compatible &#x2F; integrated with the ThreeFold) to power and optimize their data processing capabilities, as well as the overall functionality of their dApps. But the sweet spot is that it is deployed on a decentralized IT infrastructure, close to where users would be located.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why-choose-threefold-over-other-decloud-projects&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#but-why-choose-threefold-over-other-decloud-projects&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: but-why-choose-threefold-over-other-decloud-projects&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;But why choose ThreeFold over other DeCloud projects?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be bigger names in the space, but ThreeFold‚Äôs technology and offerings are much more comprehensive than the rest. ThreeFold provides decentralized storage, compute, and network all under one roof (whereas most other projects offer only one of the three) and as mentioned, we have created an environment for developers which is highly-compatible to the developer tools and solutions they use today. Further, ThreeFold is building new infrastructure &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;from the ground up&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (rather than relying on extra space in data centers) and the technology is truly peer-to-peer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&#x2F;blockchain&quot;&gt;a number of partners in the space&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who recognize these advantages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any blockchain protocol or dApp, whether operating DeFi, NFTs, DEXs, etc, will at some point need to leverage the power of the decentralized cloud and escape from centralized cloud providers. We‚Äôre seeing some of that adoption from a decentralized storage side with IPFS, which has been adopted by many dApps, and others ‚Äì but as a developer, you will have to think twice, not just about where your&#x2F;your users‚Äô data is being stored, but also about how (and where) your app is computed and powered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participate now in our quest to fully decentralize the Internet by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;becoming a node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on our grid or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;buying TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third stop on our journey that aims to better understand the space we operate in and how ThreeFold stands out. After exploring &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dfinity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_2_akash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I will now take a closer look at Filecoin to discover the similarities as well as differences of their project and ThreeFold. Let‚Äôs dive right in!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;filecoin-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#filecoin-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: filecoin-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Filecoin &amp;amp; how the project compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&quot;&gt;Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a global decentralized storage network and marketplace, founded in 2014 and based on the peer-to-peer protocol &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipfs.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The open-source project is one of the most popular providers of decentralized storage, with people storing files reliably on their mainnet. Like IPFS, Filecoin was founded by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protocol.ai&quot;&gt;Protocol Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ipfs.io&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#ipfs-and-filecoin&quot;&gt;IPFS and Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are two separate but complementary open-source protocols. IPFS enables users to store, request, and transfer their data on Filecoin in a reliable way and directly from the IPFS network. As we deeply care about data security and privacy, I‚Äôd like to point out that IPFS &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ipfs.io&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;privacy-and-encryption&#x2F;#what-s-public-on-ipfs&quot;&gt;does not provide a privacy layer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and that, subsequently, ‚Äúall traffic on IPFS is public‚Äù ‚Äì meaning there is no guarantee that your data would be stored privately and confidentially. At ThreeFold, we‚Äôre determined to provide a holistically &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;secure IT ecosystem&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with various secure and private &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;solutions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, such as our Quantum Safe File System (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;QSFS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;planetary-network&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to empower users by giving them control and ownership of their data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filecoin provides a persistent data storage system and has built an incentive structure on top of the IPFS protocol to reward the provisioning of storage for other people‚Äôs data. The project offers a peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;store&#x2F;#intro&quot;&gt;cloud storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; network and marketplace, offering an open market and reducing entry barriers to becoming a storage provider.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also offer a peer-to-peer network and cloud solution. Our ThreeFold Grid is the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;most advanced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; distributed peer-to-peer network there is, currently present in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&quot;&gt;more than 50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While Filecoin also has its own underlying blockchain, we‚Äôre the first full-stack blockchain-enabled cloud to be made open source. Moreover, we offer an energy-efficient &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;full stack cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that unites compute, storage, and network, and integrates all leading industry-standard tools ‚Äì allowing for a seamless migration of any digital workload, even from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;traditional cloud providers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; like Microsoft Azure or AWS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our cloud solution, developers are also enabled to deploy virtual machines or to discover the future of cloud computing with ZFlist, a game-changing Docker-compatible solution. As &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zflist&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is distributed across many mini virtual machines (VMs), it provides the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads on a highly secure level. On top of that, the data produced by these workloads can be stored in our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_pt2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (QSFS) solution. Our QSFS is highly compatible with most storage tools (e.g. S3) and protocols (e.g. IPFS). In addition to that, developers using our tech are enabled to set the terms for storing their workloads based on their needs ‚Äì they even have the opportunity to scale their applications to the edge with powerful compute and storage capabilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contributing and lending storage capacity on Filecoin‚Äôs marketplace, providers receive rewards, executed by Filecoin‚Äôs blockchain. However, providers can only participate in Filecoin‚Äôs market if their nodes are ‚Äú&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.filecoin.io&#x2F;about-filecoin&#x2F;what-is-filecoin&#x2F;#for-storage-providers&quot;&gt;built specifically for Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.‚Äù Actually, Filecoin nodes are IPFS nodes and their most advanced implementation is based on Lotus, the Filecoin Node Client. Our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;technology?id=_3nodes&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have easy plug-and-play functionalities, allowing even people without technical skills to participate by getting a 3Node from one of our certified hardware partners and downloading our stateless and lightweight operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the driving force behind our Grid. 3Nodes can even be plugged in at your home. Filecoin, however, doesn‚Äôt seem to offer any kind of certified hardware.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we‚Äôve built our own operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zero_os_blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;from scratch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, starting just with a Linux kernel, Filecoin doesn‚Äôt have its own OS. ThreeFold is not only more inclusive but also has a much higher scalability as anyone‚Äôs able to participate. In contrast, Filecoin even issues a warning in their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.filecoin.io&#x2F;mine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which states that in order to run a successful mining operation, one has to meet high hardware requirements and to be highly familiar with Filecoin. Thanks to our autonomous, self-healing technology, no maintenance is required. To ensure the security of our 3Nodes can‚Äôt be accessed physically once booted. Therefore, our ThreeFold Grid is much more inclusive, as the network capacity on it is provided by many people and organizations constituting what we like to call ‚Äú&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;People‚Äôs Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.‚Äù Currently, we‚Äôre planning to extend our reach to enable even more people to join the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filecoin‚Äôs native token FIL and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) are both utility tokens that fuel an open-source cloud. The earning model for FIL follows a simple logic for earning: the more storage a miner adds, the more FIL the respective miner will be rewarded with while also receiving FIL from users leasing their storage capacity. However, Filecoin miners must stake their FIL and can even lose their stake if their node does not perform, whereas our farming model doesn‚Äôt require staking, so farmers don‚Äôt risk losing their funds. In addition to that, our ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) can represent either a unit of compute, storage or network on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and our farmers are rewarded for connecting one of these types of capacity to our Grid. Moreover, we‚Äôll soon implement a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;new discount model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, providing users with discounted capacity pricings based on the amount of ThreeFold Tokens stored in a user‚Äôs wallet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Filecoin‚Äôs model, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.filecoin.io&#x2F;mine&#x2F;how-mining-works&#x2F;&quot;&gt;mining&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; means contributing storage capacity to be leased by users on the marketplace that are looking to store their data. Currently, Filecoin has two types of miners ‚Äì storage miners, who are responsible for storing data, and retrieval miners, who are responsible for the fast retrieval of files. A retrieval miner‚Äôs ‚Äúability to close retrieval deals‚Äù are determined by the miner‚Äôs respective bandwidth and response time. ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro&quot;&gt;farming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the concept of expanding the Internet with more network, compute, and storage capacity. Farmers are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;rewarded&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; income in the form of TFTs for providing internet capacity. Moreover, anyone can become a farmer, as farmers are independent from ThreeFold. There‚Äôs no technical knowledge is required to connect to our global peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure and all it takes is network bandwidth and electricity, in addition to our 3Node ‚Äì without the interference of any type of intermediary. Therefore, a ThreeFold Farmer is ThreeFold‚Äôs more sustainable equivalent of the miners of other cryptocurrencies, disrupting the centralized data center model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the two projects share the same vision of bringing users‚Äô data closer to their respective owners, establishing an open cloud market that is independent from the few big centralized cloud providers currently dominating the market. Like ThreeFold, Filecoin seeks to provide a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;store&#x2F;#flexible&quot;&gt;network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; built as well as owned by the people, regardless of their location. Nevertheless, Filecoin is focused on storage and mainly based on the IPFS protocol, only providing an incentive layer on top. In contrast, ThreeFold provides &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;all three&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; major low-level components of the internet‚Äôs backbone: compute, storage and network. Additionally, ThreeFold‚Äôs P2P Cloud offers a holistic set of solutions ‚Äì from our Planetary Network and our Quantum Safe File System to our eVDC and marketplace. All in all, the technology and infrastructure we‚Äôre providing is turning traditional IT upside down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why ThreeFold is the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;ideal substrate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for projects like Filecoin to run on, as we‚Äôre already IPFS-compatible and provide the low-level primitives for a fully decentralized cloud. So, we believe Filecoin and ThreeFold could team up to jointly drive the decentralization of cloud. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their website, Filecoin &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;build&#x2F;#community&quot;&gt;states&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that they‚Äôre all about ‚Äúcoming together to collaborate and build something greater,‚Äù so they seem open to collaboration ‚Äì which is very appealing to us, as we truly believe in collaboration to effect change at a large scale to fully decentralize the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;Internet and Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Thanks for continuing this journey with me and don‚Äôt forget to stay tuned for the next stop: Storj!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/project-comparison-2-akash/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As announced in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the first episode of this series&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I‚Äôd like to shed some light on the complex decentralization and blockchain space and look into what fellow projects have to offer. There are various projects decentralizing parts of the internet. So in this second blog post, we‚Äôll be exploring Akash and their solutions to find out what we have in common and where we differ. Follow me on the second step of my journey to better understand the space we operate in and how ThreeFold stands out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;akash-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#akash-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: akash-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Akash &amp;amp; how the project compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2015, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akash.network&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open-source and blockchain-based cloud computing platform. They &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akash.network&#x2F;about#vision&quot;&gt;strive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for an open, permissionless, and sovereign cloud that allows anyone to reserve computing resources without any intermediaries. Their cloud platform provides a simple way for deploying and scaling cloud applications. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Akash Network is a decentralized, on-chain marketplace for leasing cloud computing resources, while the Akash Container Platform is an off-chain platform for cloud management services (deployment, hosting, and management of workloads) on Kubernetes, the industry standard for container orchestration. We also integrated Kubernetes into our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;cloud#&#x2F;cloud__cloud_intro&quot;&gt;P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solution, but we didn‚Äôt stop there. On ThreeFold‚Äôs cloud solution, developers additionally have the option to deploy virtual machines or to discover the future of cloud computing with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zflist&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì a game-changing Docker-compatible solution that is distributed across many mini VMs, positioning itself as the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. And all data produced by these workloads can be stored in our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solution that is highly compatible with most storage tools (e.g. S3) and protocols (e.g. IPFS).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Akash, developers would get access to what is probably the best decentralized computing cloud on the market, whereas ThreeFold offers a full stack cloud infrastructure that unites compute, storage, and network. Having integrated all leading industry-standard tools, ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cloud solution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; allows for a seamless migration of any digital workload ‚Äì even from centralized cloud providers like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;AWS or Microsoft Azure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This empowers developers from all over the world to deploy their applications and workloads on a fully decentralized infrastructure, without having to learn new tools. Developers using Akash, however, may still need to rely on other decentralized projects to decentralize the storage and network components of their solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akash sees their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.akash.network&quot;&gt;USP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in hosting containers that allow any type of cloud-native application to be hosted without vendor lock-in or having to learn new protocols, a vision shared and extended by ThreeFold as the project is already compatible with most of the industry standards. With the integration of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-grid-3-0-supports-terraform&#x2F;1184&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; into the upcoming third release of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, developers will be capable of hosting any existing or future Linux workload seamlessly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Akash is one of the most robust decentralized compute solutions out there and is one of the key players in driving the DeCloud movement. On its platform, computing resources can be leased on the Akash Marketplace, driven by its blockchain based on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cosmos&#x2F;cosmos-sdk&quot;&gt;Cosmos SDK&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It‚Äôs already being used by a range of blockchains and applications. On their marketplace, users can determine the terms and price for their deployments and have cloud providers bid for the opportunity in a reversed auction. Nevertheless, the project still relies on centralized data centers as they seek to prevent unutilized capacity &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.orchid.com&#x2F;akash-networks-greg-osuri-on-decentralizing-cloud-computing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;from centralized cloud computing services&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to go to waste, leveraging about 85% of this underutilized cloud capacity from data centers. So, while Akash is preventing capacity from being wasted, they also highly depend on centralized capacity ‚Äì and so do the workloads using their platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ThreeFold, developers are enabled to tailor the terms for storing their workloads to fit their needs, benefiting from full decentralization and edge possibilities. Moreover, developers get access to the most distributed peer-to-peer infrastructure in the world ‚Äì the ThreeFold, currently present in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&quot;&gt;more than 50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Another unique attribute of the ThreeFold Grid is that the capacity within the network is provided by many people and organizations, forming an infrastructure that can be described as the ‚Äú&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;People‚Äôs Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.‚Äù It is the first full-stack blockchain-enabled cloud to be made open source, allowing anyone to connect cloud capacity to the network by downloading &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, our stateless and lightweight operating system powering the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Once booted, the servers run and can‚Äôt be accessed physically. As they‚Äôre self-healing, they don‚Äôt require any maintenance. All in all, this model flips traditional IT upside down, allowing anyone to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;join&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the ThreeFold ecosystem. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects also reward their communities for providing capacity. Akash planned to launch a limited edition for an own node device, called Supermini, with plug-and-play functionalities similar to our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;technology?id=_3nodes&quot;&gt;3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;However, Akash &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akash.network&#x2F;blog&#x2F;supermini-update&quot;&gt;just announced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that they‚Äôll be postponing the launch of their Supermini indefinitely, meaning they won‚Äôt be offering anything comparable to our 3Node anytime soon.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a general purpose computer that acts as  a low-level provider for IT capacity. It is booted with our unique operating system Zero-OS and enables even people without technical skills to participate. We‚Äôre collaborating with certified hardware partners and plan to extend our reach in the near future to allow even more people to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;join&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tokenomics-and-incentive-models&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tokenomics-and-incentive-models&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tokenomics-and-incentive-models&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Tokenomics and incentive models&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, Akash Token (AKT) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT), are utility tokens fuelling an open-source cloud. While the Akash Tokens (AKT) represent a unit of compute on the Akash Network, ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) represent a unit of compute, storage or network on the ThreeFold Grid. Akash‚Äôs payment model allows users to pay for what they need, when they need it, using a reverse auction. In order to create a deployment, users have to provide a deposit first. As payments are effected passively, it is crucial for users to keep their deposits funded to maintain the lease of their capacity reservations. With our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which will be released on Testnet 3.0 soon, a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;new billing model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is being introduced. This model allows users to authorize &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to automatically deduct their wallets (similarly to a direct debit transaction), depending on how much capacity they use. Additionally, we‚Äôre implementing a new discount model, which will provide users with discounted capacity pricings according to the amount of ThreeFold Tokens stored in a user‚Äôs wallet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Akash does a great job with regards to decentralizing cloud capacity. However, it doesn‚Äôt challenge the status-quo in terms of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;data privacy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. At ThreeFold, we‚Äôre determined to empower users, to give them back control and ownership of their data in an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;entirely secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer IT ecosystem. While Akash and ThreeFold seem like competitors on a cloud level, we see ourselves more as a potential &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;decentralized substrate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Akash to scale to the edges of our world. Akash developers would surely benefit from the lightweight and stateless features of our Zero-OS which could provide them with a more efficient and private infrastructure to test, build, and collaborate on workloads. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akash and ThreeFold share the same goal ‚Äì to bring secure, performant, and data-sovereign cloud solutions for humanity to thrive. As Sam &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;put in a nutshell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: ThreeFold is the ideal substrate for projects like Akash to run on, instead of depending on traditional cloud providers ‚Äì as we provide the low-level primitives for a decentralized world. So, we believe &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-is-threefold-different-from-akash-and-holochain&#x2F;804&#x2F;2&quot;&gt;Akash and ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are complementary in many ways and could  join forces to further push the boundaries of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;cloud decentralization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we truly believe in collaboration, we invite all other projects in the space to join us in our quest to decentralize the entire Internet and Cloud stack to restore the neutrality we once took for granted.

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/building-a-new-internet-from-the-ground-up-3/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome back for another installment of our accessible series on ThreeFold Grid technology. We are working through the three major     categories that make up cloud infrastructure: storage, compute, and network. This time, we‚Äôll be focusing on compute.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-compute&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-compute&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-compute&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is compute?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_pt2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and network are fairly intuitive concepts ‚Äì where data lives and how it gets around ‚Äì compute is about the more mysterious realm of data processing and ultimately computer programming. Don‚Äôt worry though, you don‚Äôt need any technical abilities to gain a deeper understanding of what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes when we use apps or interact with web sites.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;first part&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of this series, compute is basically what happens with data once it reaches its destination. Compute gives data relevance, by processing it according to the instructions provided by developers in their source code. When talking about what the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; offers in terms of compute, it‚Äôs mostly about how the code that developers produce gets executed in order to provide the services we enjoy. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ThreeFold, this actually happens for the most part using the same tools and systems provided by traditional cloud services, meaning that it‚Äôs highly compatible with existing cloud applications. What really makes the Grid different is that it‚Äôs been designed to provide a level of efficiency and security that simply isn‚Äôt possible without starting ‚Äúfrom the ground up‚Äù. Before we get into specifics of compute offerings built into ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, let‚Äôs briefly explore what computing is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;playing-with-zeroes-and-ones&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#playing-with-zeroes-and-ones&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: playing-with-zeroes-and-ones&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Playing with zeroes and ones&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything a computer‚Äôs central processing unit does is based on a limited set of instructions that includes basic mathematical functions, logical operations, and ways to control the flow of a program. At their core, computers are really just automated adding machines that execute specified operations on whatever input they receive. It may be hard to believe that simple math creates all of the vibrant digital experience we enjoy, but at a certain low level, that‚Äôs the truth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a messaging app as an example. Within a computer, all of the text, emojis, and images we see are represented by numbers. When we search for some text within a chat, matches are determined by checking if the numbers corresponding to the words we typed are equal to some numbers corresponding to words that appear in the chat history. This information is then converted into the list of results we see on screen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, compute is mostly responsible for organizing all of our messages based on the individual or group we were talking with, the time that the message happened, and whether or not we‚Äôve opened it yet. Typically, a messaging app stores data both on our local devices and on a back end in the cloud. Compute is also how the service decides to copy messages you sent on one device to other devices where you have the same app installed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an important distinction about how the ThreeFold Grid operates. In a traditional cloud environment, it is impossible to know for sure what is happening on the backend, even if you are the one running the service. The administrative access retained by the cloud provider can be used for surveillance and tampering that can be very difficult or impossible to detect. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero OS offers a unique assurance that no one can abuse the Grid in this way, because it operates autonomously with no facilities provided for human intervention. In order to utilize compute capacity on the Grid, individuals and organizations deploy their choice of several ‚Äúprimitives,‚Äù or basic components, that provide an environment for code to be executed and create the magic we experience as online applications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-compute-primitives&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-compute-primitives&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-compute-primitives&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Compute Primitives&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we‚Äôre getting a bit into the technical weeds here, we‚Äôll just take a brief look at each primitive and what makes it special.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zmachine&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zmachine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zmachine&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zmachine&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zmachine is a lightweight virtual machine (VM) implementation that‚Äôs been developed in a uniquely efficient way by ThreeFold. VMs are essentially computers within computers, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical system. A common example is running the Windows operating system on a Mac that‚Äôs already running MacOS. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud world, virtual machines are a classic way to manage complex deployments with flexibility and resilience ‚Äì by packaging different components into different VMs that can be run side by side and moved between different physical servers with ease. While VMs have been replaced in many cases with the new container paradigm, which we‚Äôll cover next, they are still widely used and provide a simpler solution than containers that‚Äôs sufficient for many use cases.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flist&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#flist&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: flist&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Flist&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F;zflist&quot;&gt;Flist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;  is a next generation container format which extends the industry standard Docker container concept in an efficient and secure way. It is supported directly at the operating system level on Zero OS, and in its latest version on ThreeFold Grid 3.0, provides a unique advantage over traditional containers via the use of mini virtual machines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers provide greater efficiency and flexibility than VMs, by sharing parts of the host operating system between containers rather than duplicating the full operating system for each component. This, however, means that containers typically come with less of an assurance that different workloads and their data remain isolated from each other. By employing mini VMs, the Flist concept provides better isolation than traditional container systems while retaining the advantages that containers offer over full VMs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kubernetes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#kubernetes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: kubernetes&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers usually represent small parts of a full solution, which are created, interconnected, and destroyed on an ongoing basis. Kubernetes is the industry standard container orchestration system, and it‚Äôs used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments. Kubernetes solutions are defined through configuration files that specify the types of containers, how updates are handled, and the network architecture both between containers and with the outside world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple physical servers or VMs are typically used for a Kubernetes ‚Äúcluster‚Äù which provides redundancy and scalability. The ThreeFold Grid provides a lightweight Kubernetes VM that can be used to create clusters according to specific needs. Kubernetes users can, for the most part, simply bring their existing configuration files and recreate their deployments on a Grid based cluster seamlessly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#wrapping-up&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: wrapping-up&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Wrapping up&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the compute primitives offer a comprehensive alternative to existing cloud compute providers. Users of Docker, Kubernetes, and virtual machines can bring their deployments to the Grid with a minimal amount of migration effort. This is distinct from other decentralized cloud projects, which either offer a single solution like Kubernetes or a completely new environment that developers must adapt their code to run within.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, each compute offering on the ThreeFold Grid benefits from the unique efficiency and security features of Zero OS, as well as the unique aspects of the primitives themselves. Thanks again for joining me on this journey into the wonderful world of ThreeFold technology. In the next episode, we‚Äôll cover the last element of the cloud infrastructure triad: network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whether you‚Äôre new to ThreeFold or have been around for a while, the decentralization and blockchain space can often be quite elusive and opaque with regards to what certain projects have to offer. Very clear, however, is the current market cap for aggregated decentralized compute and storage projects which exceeds 50 billion USD. Therefore, we decided to shed some light on the space and to show you how our solutions compare to those of other projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first one in a series to explore fellow projects and their solutions with regards to what they share with ThreeFold but also where we differ. Follow me on my journey through the decentralization and blockchain space to get a better understanding of where we are within the space. First up: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-journey-through-the-decentralization-and-blockchain-space-part-one-dfinity&#x2F;1316&quot;&gt;Dfinity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dfinity-foundation-how-it-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-dfinity-foundation-how-it-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-dfinity-foundation-how-it-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The DFINITY Foundation &amp;amp; how it compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dfinity.org&#x2F;foundation&quot;&gt;DFINITY Foundation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a not-for-profit organization, founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams and headquartered in Z√ºrich, Switzerland. With a team of more than 200 people, Dfinity is developing the technology for the Internet Computer blockchain. It seeks to free the Internet from big tech and monopolization and return to the Internet‚Äôs open roots by offering a public blockchain on which systems and dApps can be rebuilt in a secure and scalable way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the term ‚Äúrebuild‚Äù already indicates, Dfinity‚Äôs own SDK has to be used to build on their platform, whereas ThreeFold is highly compatible with industry standards tools and protocols (e.g. Linux-based workloads, S3, Docker containers, Kubernetes). This allows for existing applications to be easily migrated onto the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while also offering unparalleled levels of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;security&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, privacy and decentralization. Moreover, Dfinity‚Äôs architecture is blockchain-based and offers a platform for dApps, while ThreeFold is based on its own operating system, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and is a platform for P2P network, storage and compute. The ThreeFold Grid uses a blockchain internally only where it is truly needed while also offering the missing capacity layer which enables every blockchain to become &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;decentralize_blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;truly decentralized&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that Dfinity is more about creating an ecosystem of independent data centers, whereas ThreeFold turns the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data center model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; upside down by enabling anyone to become a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.threefold.tech&#x2F;index.php?route=common&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the system. Even non-technical people can &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;join the network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play offerings through ThreeFold‚Äôs certified hardware partners. The ThreeFold Grid is therefore &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;more inclusive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and allows individuals to participate as well, which enables ThreeFold to scale an unlimited number of nodes, whereas Dfinity currently uses a limited set of existing data centers. The question remains of whether they will incentivise an easier way into their system. ThreeFold‚Äôs model is not only infinitely scalable but also can act as the ideal substrate for edge computing which is difficult for Dfinity to achieve with its more centralized structure. Also, Threefold‚Äôs self-driving and self-healing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is unique in the space and removes the pain of having to monitor and maintain the nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ThreeFold‚Äôs Zero-OS was created from scratch and its low-level design allows it to achieve unparalleled levels of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;security&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and decentralization. With VMs, Kubernetes, a next-generation container environment, and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold‚Äôs offering is much more comprehensive than Dfinity‚Äôs canister offering. A potential collaboration, however, could be beneficial for Dfinity. By hosting their offerings on the ThreeFold Grid, Dfinity could benefit from ThreeFold‚Äôs fully decentralized and autonomous infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, Dfinity and ThreeFold, share the same ambition to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tgdaily.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;6-dfinity-threefold-are-leading-an-internet-decentralization-revolution&#x2F;&quot;&gt;revolutionize the Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While both provide a platform for dApps to be built upon, ThreeFold has a much more comprehensive and compatible stack. Therefore, Dfinity could benefit from moving to the ThreeFold Grid as an underlying &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, rather than depending on their more centralized data center structure. In addition to that, their data center operators could also choose to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;become farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the ThreeFold Grid, while continuing to host Dfinity ‚Äì without having to worry about system administration and maintenance as ThreeFold‚Äôs technology is fully self-healing. In that way they could finally run on a fully decentralized, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and self-healing infrastructure ‚Äì and as Dfinity &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dfinity.org&#x2F;foundation&quot;&gt;stated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, they‚Äôre ‚Äúcommitted to connecting those who believe the same‚Äù, so we hope to find the spirit of decentralization and collaboration in our future engagements.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Based on their shared commitment to data sovereignty and open alternatives, ownCloud and ThreeFold have agreed to enter into a strategic partnership to advance the decentralization of the consumer cloud. ownCloud is an open-source file sync, share and content collaboration software that lets teams work on data easily from anywhere, on any device. ThreeFold is developing a peer-to-peer Internet platform that aims to liberalize what it labels as a centralized and unequally distributed Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step in the partnership is &lt;strong&gt;the launch of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.owncloud.com&quot;&gt;ownCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; instance on the ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=2ZkpsG6dQvw&quot;&gt;demoed live&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; at ownCloud Conference 2021&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; ‚Äì and &lt;strong&gt;the development of  a pilot program (register your interest by emailing testowncloud@threefold.io)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. The long-term vision is &lt;strong&gt;a full range of file sync, file sharing and content collaboration solutions&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; that combine the strengths of both technologies. ThreeFold and ownCloud are excited to develop complementary offerings that reflect their shared beliefs in open standards and digital sovereignty. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúownCloud is partnering with ThreeFold to deliver a solution for customers with the demand for data sovereignty, privacy, and ultra-security of their data assets. ownCloud powered by ThreeFold Grid delivers on these exact attributes offering a truly decentralized, secure and scalable infrastructure to complement the proven and globally adopted ownCloud collaboration platform,‚Äù Joerg Eberwein, VP Partners &amp;amp; Alliances, ownCloud GmbH.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; built the world‚Äôs most decentralized, secure and scalable digital infrastructure. They already have the largest decentralized cloud infrastructure in the world with about 80,000,000 GB deployed across 50 countries, and counting. The ThreeFold Cloud represents the first fully comprehensive decentralized cloud and is integrated with industry-leading tools and protocols for a seamless transition towards web3. Anything that runs on Linux can run on ThreeFold, but better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúownCloud powered by ThreeFold offers a purposeful use case of the ThreeFold Grid and aligns with our mission to ensure data privacy and sovereignty for everyone. Combining the longstanding credibility of ownCloud and the decentralized cloud technology of ThreeFold results in a 1+1=3 value statement,‚Äù Chris Hutton, Co-Founder, ThreeFold Tech.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold allows people to host their own applications anywhere on their decentralized cloud infrastructure via smart contract. This provides a powerful solution for ownCloud users to host their collaboration tools anywhere they want, independently from conventional, centralized cloud providers, and without having to maintain the servers and software themselves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-from-censorship-and-user-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#free-from-censorship-and-user-tracking&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: free-from-censorship-and-user-tracking&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Free from censorship and user tracking&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ownCloud can be installed anywhere, providing a secure and sovereign alternative to public cloud providers ‚Äã‚Äãfor more than 200 million users worldwide as of today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ownCloud running on the ThreeFold Grid infrastructure, users can manage their ‚Äúown‚Äù cloud on a neutral cloud infrastructure that is free from censorship, user tracking and privacy breaches. This is made possible by Zero-OS, ThreeFold‚Äôs stateless and lightweight operating system that allows servers to run autonomously. The self-driving and self-healing features eliminate backdoors and reduce the hacking surface, to keep ownCloud instances secure at all times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ownCloud and ThreeFold have a history of delivering technical collaborations amongst various projects. While ownCloud excels at delivering secure and private collaboration platforms, ThreeFold offers a robust and flexible large-scale cloud layer. Combining both projects provides new possibilities in regards to governance, reliability and security for users and their data. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the highly anticipated 3rd release of ThreeFold‚Äôs technology expected to launch this quarter, &lt;strong&gt;ownCloud and ThreeFold are preparing a pilot program&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to leverage their infrastructure and software expertise to deliver truly self-sovereign collaboration solutions in the world. ownCloud and ThreeFold are currently working out the details of their pilot program, which will be announced at a future date.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the two are &lt;strong&gt;planning a cross-community event&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, where community members can learn more about the two technologies and hear further details about the collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join our beta tester group by sending an email to testowncloud@threefold.io to be amongst the first to try ownCloud on a self-sovereign environment!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is developing a peer-to-peer internet platform that aims to liberalize what it labels as a centralized and unequally distributed internet. Its platform, called the ThreeFold Grid, comprises over +1000 servers in 50+ different countries around the world, delivering approximately 80 PB in storage and over 22,000 CPU cores worldwide, making it the largest storage and compute peer-to-peer internet network in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each server runs ThreeFold‚Äôs stateless and lightweight open-source operating system, Zero-OS, and is set up and operated by independent individuals and organisations called Farmers. Farmers earn rewards in TFT - the platform‚Äôs native token - for their participation. TFT is the currency of the ThreeFold Grid, with each token representing a unit of storage and compute on the platform. Grid users can use these tokens to reserve the storage and compute they need to store, build and share on the platform‚Äôs internet network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Interview ‚Äì Designing Solutions for a P2P Future</title>
		<published>2021-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/interview-with-jimber/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/interview-with-jimber/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I met with Jonas Delrue from Jimber, the team developing P2P solutions like video chat, office workspace, isolated web browser, and messaging, using the Digital Twin platform. Digital Twin is a use case on top of the ThreeFold Grid. We talked about the technical hurdles and motivations for developing private, decentralized, and open source alternatives to popular products from major corporations.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The following has been edited lightly for clarity and flow.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I‚Äôm wondering about this video chat solution that we‚Äôre using for the interview right now. Building reliable video conferencing took a long time for the industry to get right, as far as I understand, and this seems very comparable in performance to Zoom. What did it take to produce this, what challenges came up, and what open source components are you using?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yes, the solution is fully open source, using Janus as a back end which is a signaling and MTU server that handles all the traffic. But the main reason why we created our own solution is because we want to deploy the solution on the ThreeFold Grid and make a really decentralized video application. So everyone can start their own video room and the data will only be shared between the members of the room, instead of going through Zoom.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The reasons for this have become very clear in the latest developments at Zoom where they had the lawsuits for end-to-end encryption. So something that our solution will offer is not only end-to-end encryption but also the traffic won‚Äôt go through central points ‚Äì so there‚Äôs no way for us to eavesdrop on any of the conversations as a company since we‚Äôre not included in the process. So that‚Äôs the main reason that we created this one.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Very cool. I know for Zoom free accounts, all traffic is routed through servers in the United States which also has performance implications for anyone in other parts of the world. You have this big transatlantic hop back and forth for people talking to each other in different parts of Europe, for example, which could create lag or dropouts. And of course, the privacy feature is super important, because if we‚Äôre using Zoom or any other centralized service it‚Äôs a black box. They say your connections are end-to-end encrypted, but there‚Äôs no way to verify that without open source code and self hosting.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yep, so what we offer is fully open source, and using the Digital Twin platform you‚Äôll be able to start your own solutions, so it‚Äôs fully in your own hands.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Do you know what kind of resources are required to run the video chat server?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The CPU and memory usage on the server is very low, but bit rate depends on how good your connection is and how high quality you want to use. Right now we have some default quality but we will be able to make that configurable, so you‚Äôll be able to choose how much data that you want to consume during your conversation, which will of course imply a better or a worse resolution and experience.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Totally. I‚Äôve heard that we should be able to host many Digital Twins on a single node. I‚Äôm curious of your thoughts on that. How many Digital Twins do you think we could run on a single Titan node or server in a rack?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;That‚Äôs a hard one. I‚Äôd have to check for real numbers on the current implementation, but the thing is that there‚Äôs not really a hard limit, as long as you keep improving your software and making it more efficient, making it more suitable to the scaling case. Right now in centralized systems this mostly is not a concern, but if you make it more suitable to self hosting and the digital twin scenario, then we should be able to get really far on that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It‚Äôs going to take some effort and time to improve it and to make it better so the usage goes down, while the hardware also gets better so it‚Äôs two ways. I think in the long run we should be able to host really lots and lots of Digital Twins on one single node. It also depends on what you‚Äôre doing on the Digital Twins, if everyone is doing video conversations it will of course have more consumption than if everyone is just chatting in text.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
There‚Äôs a good number of features here in video chat already like the background replace and some others I was impressed to see already during my testing. Of course Zoom has many more features like hosting these large conferences, breakout groups, allowing people to raise their hand digitally. I‚Äôm wondering what features are on the road map for this solution and what should we expect to see coming next?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Raising hands is one of the things that we‚Äôre developing now, but we‚Äôre mostly doing improvements at the back end so we can get a more efficient solution and a solution that is better suited to the decentralized way of working. Now, we don‚Äôt have the size of team that Zoom has of course at this point, so we‚Äôre a bit slower in releasing new features. We do have a list of things that we want to implement in the near future. Things like waiting rooms and all the stuff that you came up with, they‚Äôre on the road map but not for the very short term since right now we‚Äôre really focusing on getting this thing working in a decentralized way on the Grid.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That makes sense. And what is the status of that? Are we using the Grid right now, or is this a staging server?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a production server of Jimber. We use this one to talk to our employees, so for internal calls, and we‚Äôre also using it to talk to clients. We‚Äôve been using it for over six months without any problems so it‚Äôs really production ready, but this version is not running on the Grid right now. We do have deployments on the Grid that work perfectly.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Good to know. Is that something that someone with the proper amount of knowledge and motivation could test for themselves already, running the solution on the Grid?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, they should be able to. It might be that they still need a little bit of help from the technical team, but it should be doable, yes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Cool, I‚Äôll put that on my list of things to try out. So that‚Äôs video chat. Do you see any challenges arising from quirks of the Grid in implementing any features or scaling things up to a certain level. Is there anything that‚Äôs tricky about moving something like this onto the Grid?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It‚Äôs more about the Digital Twin than the meeting solution itself. Right now we‚Äôre really working on getting the Digital Twin able to launch for a single person, so we‚Äôre checking out how we‚Äôll do the deployments, the payment flow, things like that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So for us, that‚Äôs the challenge right now, but in the long run it‚Äôs probably going to be scaling, being sure that the Digital Twin runs close enough to the person actually using it, being sure that the interaction between Digital Twins is really fast and with low latency. Things like that will of course be a huge challenge, and also keeping everything private, making sure that everything is secure is also a bit challenging.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Another big challenge is that users are not used to a decentralized environment. So if you lose your seed phrase or in some way destroy your own Digital Twin, it‚Äôs decentralized so we can‚Äôt access it. There isn‚Äôt a company that can just look into the big system and fix it for you. You are a bit responsible for your own system so that‚Äôs also a bit of a challenge. So to get users informed and make software that‚Äôs really easy for them, where they can‚Äôt mess things up, and where users can give us enough logs when something goes wrong to help them in a decentralized way.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
For sure, I know that‚Äôs a big concern around our VDC solution as well. You onboard someone into the system and they need to take responsibility for their own data and deployments. I think that‚Äôs a huge issue across this space right, you want to give people the power but they also need to be able to take the responsibility. We‚Äôll see how that goes, as users start to come onboard and what kinds of challenges they run into.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, that‚Äôs going to be the fun part, once users really start onboarding and start using everything. It‚Äôs mostly a stressful situation at first if you launch a new product, but we‚Äôre going to be starting off with a beta version so we don‚Äôt get too much ahead of ourselves. Using the beta period to really get the software to be at the point where we need it for production will probably be the best step, to take the stress a bit off the team, and in the next version we can go full fledged production with a really nice product.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
How soon do you think we‚Äôll be ready to invite some members of the community to start testing?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We want to have a version ready for September, so that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre looking at.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Great. Let‚Äôs shift gears and talk about the file browser and office solution, which I‚Äôve also tested. It‚Äôs very cool. You‚Äôre able to preview images and videos, edit documents, and more. I understand it‚Äôs at least two open source components, you have the file browser and OnlyOffice working together.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So the file browser is totally made by us, it‚Äôs fully new. We use OnlyOffice as a document service to edit the documents, and right now you can already share documents with other people and collaborate on documents. We‚Äôre building a kind of online office alternative that is owned by you and where your files are safe from companies trying to get data from it to give you specific advertisements and that sort of thing.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Okay, I didn‚Äôt realize that the file browser piece had been built in house.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It‚Äôs still very basic. It doesn‚Äôt have all the features of the big ones yet. It has the basic functionality‚Äîyou can upload files, make folders, put the files in the folders, open files, collaborate, save them, share with people, all of those things are available, so it‚Äôs pretty usable. This has been launched in a staging version right now, so it‚Äôs not available to the full public yet but it should be available in September when we launch the first Digital Twin version.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I‚Äôve tested it, and it works really well. I‚Äôm curious again‚Äîobviously building something like this isn‚Äôt a small task. Building an alternative to products from massive corporations with huge budgets and teams. So for your team, what are the challenges and how did you make this work?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Of course using open source components like OnlyOffice is a big difference. It‚Äôd be hard to make all of the documents services ourselves‚Äîthat would be really insane. So using open source components is a big key factor in this, but a second thing is that our team has been building and trying out stuff like this for a few years so we do have some experience in building these kinds of tools.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So in Digital Twin we also have the chat solution. Is there anything about chat that‚Äôs cool or unique?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We‚Äôre looking at the big modern chat applications for our ideas there, as well as adding some new stuff in it. For the most part you have all the features that you need. You can send text messages and audio streams. You can send GIFs, which is of course the most important feature in any chat application. Then there‚Äôs, block users, delete users, add users to make group conversations, share files with the whole group, all the things like that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Does that mean that we should be able to switch from Telegram sometime in the near future?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I hope so yeah, it would be really cool when we can do that. The biggest difference of course is the underlying decentralized architecture.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So finally, to wrap up, maybe you could talk a bit about how privacy and security is handled? We have end-to-end encryption, we have self hosting of data. What does that look like and how is it built?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In terms of the platform itself, that‚Äôs something that the ThreeFold core team is more working on, so I know the principles and know how it works but I can‚Äôt give you real technical details. As for what we build, the biggest tool that we use right now for end-to-end encryption is Yggdrasil or the Planetary Network, as we refer to it in ThreeFold. So that‚Äôs a technology where multiple computers form one grid and they can exchange messages with each other which are fully end-to-end encrypted, using the standard TCP stack of those nodes. In that way we can communicate between Digital Twins in a very easy way, using standard technology, but just changing the underlying network architecture.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Totally, I know a bit about Yggdrasil. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to test it myself, but it‚Äôs super exciting technology, right? It allows anyone behind a firewall to still have a public address where they can still be reachable on IPv6 and everything is encrypted.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And as soon as you‚Äôre connected to one node, you‚Äôre connected to every one of them, because they all forward the packets, all end to end encrypted. So it‚Äôs a really cool technology.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Absolutely, and it‚Äôs great to be able to build on this kind of stuff. Like you‚Äôre saying, the open source components give us a big head start in trying to build these alternatives.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Indeed.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Is there anything else you‚Äôd like to say about what you all have been building over there?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The whole ride has been really cool, we‚Äôre kind of working on a few things at once, and ThreeFold is one of the components of it. For us it‚Äôs a very exciting project, it‚Äôs very technical and building something entirely new that doesn‚Äôt exist yet using all these open source components. So for the team it‚Äôs a very cool challenge, we really like to work on it, and it drives the team to create something really cool. It‚Äôs a great opportunity.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I love that, and it‚Äôs a big reason I‚Äôm excited to be involved with ThreeFold as well: building something that‚Äôs totally new, going from 0 to 1, and then inviting the world to come check it out and enjoy all the benefits.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Oh yeah, I forgot to ask about the web browser. I understand that Jimber has been building this for a while and I‚Äôve seen some things about this on your website. So the web browser solution essentially renders the webpage on the back end and just shows the user an image of it?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, it caches the page on the back end and forwards the data to the client where it‚Äôs rendered. So the code of the website itself doesn‚Äôt reach you, and that‚Äôs a solution that we use for multiple things. One is to protect APIs from getting attacked by users, what we call web application isolation. The second use case is where we have an office environment where people browse the internet and they use our solution to kind of make a gap between the computer in the company and the internet itself. But they can still browse the web and use all their favorite tools without having the risk of getting viruses and things like that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I didn‚Äôt realize that there‚Äôs benefit on the server end as well. So by requiring users to interact with a web service through the browser solution, that provides isolation for the app as well?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If users are going to the service they are going through our browser, which will fetch the service for you and just give you a state of how it looks so that way we can really protect the back end of the applications from multiple attacks.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And does this effectively provide a VPN for users as well?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It‚Äôs kind of the same thing, yes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That‚Äôs super exciting. Something that folks ask me about when they learn about ThreeFold is hosting VPNs on the Grid as a way to get the benefits of VPN in a decentralized way.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yggdrasil is a bit closer to a VPN than our browser itself, but they pretty much help each other out. The browser in the ThreeFold network is used to protect the Digital Twin itself, to make it very secure and private for you, but the browser can also be used to browse websites from any country in the world without restrictions. So it can be used in that way too, which is kind of similar to how people at home use VPNs.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That‚Äôs good to know. Well, I really like the bigger picture here of an internet experience that‚Äôs end-to-end encrypted, where all of your data is under your control, and you have the anonymity and privacy that a VPN would provide. It‚Äôs very exciting stuff, and I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing about it with our larger community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/building-a-new-internet-from-the-ground-up/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome back for the second part of this introductory series on ThreeFold Grid technology. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; we took a high level view of all that the Grid offers. This time, we‚Äôll be zooming in on storage, covering the low level components and how they can¬†provide a familiar experience like the cloud ‚Äúdrives‚Äù and ‚Äúboxes‚Äù we use today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold Grid offers several different storage primitives that can be combined in various ways to meet the needs of developers and end users of Grid capacity. Ultimately, all storage services are a way of presenting the underlying hardware to software workloads in various ways, according to the desired features. ThreeFold has created a few unique storage offerings, providing distinct benefits over legacy cloud infrastructure. From the start, every component has been designed for optimal¬†efficiency and they work together to offer an unprecedented level of security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our most basic storage primitive is a ‚Äúvolume‚Äù, which simply offers some disk space to an application in a generic way. We‚Äôll focus more on the innovative solutions that are built on the Zero Database, or Zdb. These are compatible with existing use cases but also represent a quantum leap forward for privacy and security. They are called Zdbfs, Zstor, and QSFS. Let‚Äôs take a look at each component and how they work together to provide a complete set of tools for developers building on the Grid. We‚Äôll also see why this matters to end users of services that are hosted on the Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zdb&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zdb&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zdb&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zdb&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zdb is a low level offering that implements with a subset of features from the popular Redis protocol. It is a key-value store, which means that information is indexed like a dictionary. Each ‚Äúword‚Äù in the database is associated with a ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù or piece of data. Zdb is super fast and efficient, along with operating in an ‚Äúappend only‚Äù manner. This means that all new data is added to empty space following the end of existing data, never overwritten. It‚Äôs like writing in pen on paper without leaving any white space.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Append only has many advantages, including extending the life of certain hardware and offering archiving features out of the box. The disadvantage, of course, is that old data is retained even when no longer needed. However, this can be addressed by periodically ‚Äúcompacting‚Äù the data, to remove what‚Äôs no longer needed and restructure what remains with the same level of efficiency. We use Zdb as a base layer for more complex storage implementations that benefit from these features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zdbfs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zdbfs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zdbfs&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zdbfs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zdb has all of those neat properties, it requires that applications utilize a specific database interface. To expand its capabilities, we have the Zdb Filesystem. With Zdbfs, the back end Zdb is exposed through the most common interface used for storing and retrieving data: a filesystem. This is the same format we‚Äôre all familiar with from the file explorers on our computers. When running Zdbfs, a new ‚Äúfolder‚Äù appears on the system, allowing reading and writing to the connected Zdb without any concern for the underlying database. With Zdbfs, nearly all existing tools for working with data can be plugged in to and benefit from the advantages of Zdb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zstor&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zstor&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zstor&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zstor&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we‚Äôve been discussing solutions that utilize storage space on a single node only. While this offers flexibility for developers with a variety of needs, it is also limited in the sense that the failure of a single node would result in the loss of all data. With that in mind, we offer the Zstor solution for spreading data across multiple nodes in a way that provides both resilience against failures and unprecedented security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Zstor takes a single file as input, to be stored among a number of nodes as specified in its configuration. The system is flexible and able to cater to different needs for performance, redundancy, and geographical distribution. Understanding what happens behind the scenes requires a little math, but I‚Äôll provide as simple an explanation as I can. Zstor has a very unique property: it does not actually upload any of the user‚Äôs data to the back end nodes, but it is able to reconstruct the data later based on the descriptive information that is stored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-magic-of-erasure-encoding&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-magic-of-erasure-encoding&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-magic-of-erasure-encoding&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The magic of erasure encoding&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like magic? Well, let‚Äôs explore briefly how this is possible. Zstor relies on a technology known as erasure encoding, which was originally designed to protect data against errors that sometimes occur in the normal operation of computer hardware. Rather than simply making copies of the data as backups, a clever scheme is used to efficiently offer the same benefit. With basic redundancy, four extra copies would be needed to accommodate four failures without a loss of data. Erasure encoding can accomplish the same failure tolerance using less than half the space needed for the original data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While erasure encoding can be implemented by storing the data itself along with some extra data known as ‚Äúparity‚Äù, it can also be implemented without storing the original data at all. As a simplified example, let‚Äôs say that we want to store the number 13. First, we take each digit individually, 1 and 3. Next, we calculate 1 + 3 = 4 and 3 - 1 = 2. By storing 4 and 2, along with the instructions to reverse these calculations, we have everything needed to get back to 13. If we add one more equation, say 1 - 3 = -2, we can restore the original data using any two of the numbers we‚Äôve computed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Each of our values would be stored on separate nodes, while the instructions to recombine them would be stored in yet another location. If an attacker were to compromise one of these nodes, they would only have a number that‚Äôs meaningless without the other elements. If a single node fails, the original data can be restored using the remaining nodes, and we can add a new node to bring us back to our desired state. By tuning these values, additional security or redundancy can be achieved. We might decide that we want 9 of 10 values to be present for reconstruction, representing a high level of security. Alternatively, a 2 of 10 arrangement would provide high redundancy, tolerating the failure of 8 nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;quantum-safe-filesystem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#quantum-safe-filesystem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: quantum-safe-filesystem&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Quantum Safe Filesystem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these components working together, we have ThreeFold‚Äôs flagship storage solution, the Quantum Safe Filesystem or QSFS. It uses Zstor to backup data written to a Zdbfs. This provides the convenient and highly compatible filesystem interface along with the exceptional security and redundancy benefits of Zstor. We call it quantum safe, because even an attacker with a quantum computer would not be able to decode users‚Äô data, if they managed to hack into one of the back end nodes‚Äîalready an extraordinary feat given the exceptional security of Zero OS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-it-home&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bringing-it-home&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bringing-it-home&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Bringing it home&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we‚Äôve toured a good bit of technology which might be feeling a bit abstract at this point. Bringing this home, our front end experience with these technologies can feel no different than any of the ‚Äúdrives‚Äù and ‚Äúboxes‚Äù we use to store our files in the cloud. In fact, ThreeFold has already developed a prototype file browser based on QSFS which has many cool features like editing documents and viewing media directly in the web interface. It‚Äôs one piece of a full suite of solutions we‚Äôre excited to showcase and invite the community to test soon.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I hope you found this piece informative and approachable. Thanks for joining me to learn and explore the wonderful world of ThreeFold technology. We‚Äôll cover more aspects of what makes it all tick in future parts of this series. Do you have questions or feel like chatting about what‚Äôs possible with ThreeFold‚Äôs technology?

		<title>This ThreeFold Farm Keeps Veggies Warm</title>
		<published>2021-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-07-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/blockheating-intro/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/blockheating-intro/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in the Netherlands, a ThreeFold Farm is supporting the growth of vegetable crops such as tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. By directing the excess heat generated from the hardware operations to the greenhouse next door, they are able to achieve an incredible model that benefits both hardware and vegetables. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Jeroen Burks, CEO of Blockheating, tells us everything we need to know about their sustainable farming operations. As far as he can remember, Jeroen has always been a protagonist of the ‚Äúno waste‚Äù approach. He started by recycling material previously used by the tech industry, mainly in the cloud market. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúBy default, most data center operations replace their power supplies every 3 years, no matter the state they are in. They are being replaced to counter any possible downtime.‚Äù 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By refurbishing and repurposing ‚Äúold‚Äù power units from data centers, he gives them a second life as electric tractor chargers, lithium ION pack chargers, and more. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúYou just need to trick the unit into thinking it is still powering servers, add some cables here and there, and it is ready for duty.‚Äù 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
His quest towards sustainability started when he was challenged on a pilot project. His friend had bought a new building and was looking for the most sustainable approach to heating it. Jeroen came up with the idea of putting two server racks in the basement and using the heat from that operation, to heat the offices and spaces above. While this project was a success, Jeroen realised that it could be way more efficient, if done with other structures. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
He quickly engaged with a second pilot project where he used two server racks to heat a small greenhouse. This model turned out to be a great combination, which benefited both hardware, as well as farming operations. And so sprouted ‚ÄòBlockheating‚Äô ‚Äì a data center that provides heat for tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers. Why specifically these vegetables? Well, the Netherlands has a fair amount of greenhouses cultivating them, and these ‚Äòveggies‚Äô need that heat during summer nights. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Right now Blockheating has around 400 compute nodes with direct cooling that stores all the heat in a buffer throughout the day, which is then released into the greenhouses during the night hours.
‚ÄúBy doing it the way we do, we grow the internet grid, help grow vegetables and curb fossil fuel usage ‚Äì in carbon negative compute power!‚Äù 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Right now, Blockheating has a portion of their data center dedicated to ThreeFold Farming for a few reasons:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The alignment of values is huge&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold Farming is easy to manage&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold Farming counters wasteful behavior of internet resources, so it‚Äôs a triple win&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Blockheating envisions to scale up-to three data centers of this kind, in an interconnected way, with a fiber ring between them. By doing so, they will be able to increase their offering and have a larger impact on countering the wasteful patterns of the cloud industry. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold is proud to have Blockheating as a ‚ÄòState-of-the-Art‚Äô Farmer and Partner, and hopes to see many more people and companies inspired by Blockheating around the world, to expand the ‚ÄòPeople‚Äôs Internet‚Äô in a regenerative way.

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An Intro to the ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a farmer or member of the ThreeFold community, you may be wondering about the capacity provided by the ThreeFold Grid and how it‚Äôs relevant to individuals and businesses who currently rely on centralized corporate clouds. This can be hard to imagine, because the back end infrastructure that makes all of our apps and services tick is generally invisible to us. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece will be the first in a series where I‚Äôll be working to understand what the technical components are and how ThreeFold provides an alternative with distinct benefits for individuals, businesses, and for the planet as a whole. But don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll start from the ground level and build up understanding in a way that‚Äôs accessible to everyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;infrastructure-for-a-new-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#infrastructure-for-a-new-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: infrastructure-for-a-new-internet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Infrastructure for a New Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the internet? In short, it is a network of interconnected devices that facilitates communication and commerce. These devices include our mobile phones and personal computers, but also the servers that store and process data to provide the end experiences we enjoy. Currently the vast majority of these servers live in massive data centers controlled by a handful of corporations. ThreeFold is changing this, by allowing anyone to connect computational and storage capacity to an open network that is available for all to use, known as the ThreeFold Grid. Our farmers do include some data centers operating on a smaller scale than major cloud providers, and also many individuals connecting nodes at their home or office all over the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ThreeFold Grid, servers are known as 3Nodes. A 3Node can be pretty much any modern computer system, offering capacity by running the Zero OS operating system. This is a major distinguishing factor, both from the traditional cloud computing world and also from other projects working to create decentralized networks in this space. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-os-for-a-next-generation-cloud&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-os-for-a-next-generation-cloud&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-os-for-a-next-generation-cloud&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The OS for a Next Generation Cloud&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By starting from the operating system level, ThreeFold is able to provide a network with much stronger security and greater efficiency than anything that came before. Zero OS includes a collection of components, known as ‚Äúprimitives‚Äù, which provide developers with everything they need. These primitives can be used to migrate existing applications from the legacy cloud and also to create new solutions that leverage the Grid‚Äôs capacity in unique ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre all familiar with operating systems like Windows and MacOS that provide an interface to applications on our personal computers. The OS interacts with the underlying hardware to expose its capabilities in a way that‚Äôs useful for both the software it hosts and also the humans who utilize it. For example, when you launch an app on your phone, it is the OS that‚Äôs responsible for connecting it to data networks and providing access to peripherals like cameras or microphones. Things are a little different in the world of servers, where rather than through direct interactions, users benefit through the services provided to the applications we use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the example, when you open a messaging app it will connect to a server somewhere to check for new messages and relay any messages you are sending to the recipient. Here we can see a central issue that has inspired the design of ThreeFold‚Äôs technology: when our messages pass through servers controlled by others, it creates an open door for surveillance of all kinds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold farmers, on the other hand, have no administrative access to their nodes. Furthermore, each component offered by the ThreeFold Grid is built with the intention of allowing for secure and private storage, processing, and transmission of information. Of course, sharing is absolutely possible, but only when the creator of data or content chooses for it to happen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-essential-resources&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#three-essential-resources&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: three-essential-resources&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Three Essential Resources&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of cloud computing, we speak of three basic resources provided by servers: compute, storage, and network. The ThreeFold Grid provides various primitives in each of these     categories, to fulfill all the same needs served by centralized cloud providers. While our offerings have the special properties discussed above, they are also highly compatible with the most popular tools and protocols currently used in the industry. This makes it relatively simple to migrate the back end applications, also known as ‚Äúworkloads‚Äù, that provide a kind of connective tissue for all of the digital experiences we enjoy on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workloads are pieces of software that provide services. If you upload a file to some cloud storage service, there could be a number of individual workloads orchestrated together in order to ensure the data you want to save is successfully transmitted to and stored in the back end system. We can understand the need for each kind of capacity by looking at the journey that your file might take in such a scenario. Starting on your device, a network connection, some processing, and finally storage capacity are all involved in providing the conditions that allow you to retrieve that file later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;network&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#network&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: network&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Network&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networking takes place over cellular connections, wifi, and wired internet lines to move data from one place to another. For our purposes here, those details aren‚Äôt so important‚Äîwe‚Äôll focus on what happens once communication is completed by whatever means. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you connect to the cloud storage service, there are network workloads that transmit your data to the appropriate services that process and store it. This might consist of some routing and also authentication that ensures that you and only you access the files that are associated with your account. On the Grid, we provide primitives for secure peer to peer communication and also for allowing public access to back end services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;compute&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#compute&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: compute&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Compute&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute is what happens with data once it reaches its destination. Computers are mostly just fancy adding machines that take numbers and turn them into other numbers according to a set of specifications, which we call software. In our example, the compute step might involve compressing the information so it takes up less space and also deriving some useful statistics like the file‚Äôs original size. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many details we‚Äôre glossing over here, and the compute resources are ultimately responsible for providing much of our end user experience and the interactivity of the apps we utilize. 3Nodes offer a compute environment that natively runs the vast majority of workloads in use today. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;storage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#storage&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: storage&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Storage&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage, of course, is the disk space where data resides. It can be a little strange to think about, actually, that all of the information you‚Äôve stored online actually has at least one physical location where it exists as many small electrical charges. On the Grid, application developers can access the disks of nodes directly, in a way that‚Äôs optimized for energy efficiency. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have more advanced storage solutions that offer unparalleled security and low overhead redundancy, giving users the best possible guarantee that only they have access to their data and that it will actually be there when they go to retrieve it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#looking-forward&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: looking-forward&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Looking Forward&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, network, storage, and compute are the raw elements that give life to the internet we know and love. On the ThreeFold Grid, these elements are expressed in a way that‚Äôs both familiar for developers but also pushes the limits of what is possible in terms of technical evolution. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for joining me on this introductory overview of what the Grid provides. Please join me next time for a deeper dive on some of what we‚Äôve covered and more specifics about how ThreeFold technology represents a quantum leap for cloud computing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Response - The Internet is Destroying Our Brains, but We Can&#x27;t Quit</title>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/internet-destroying-brain/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I came across &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;strategy&#x2F;the-internet-is-destroying-our-brains-but-we-cant-quit-its-a-factory-were-forced-to&#x2F;z4drxf5&quot;&gt;a poignant article&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; written by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;_pem_pem&quot;&gt;P.E. Moskowitz&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;¬†entitled ‚ÄúThe internet is destroying our brains, but we can‚Äôt quit. It‚Äôs a factory we‚Äôre forced to work in without any pay.‚Äù As someone who started out in¬†social media advertising (read: trying to capture peoples‚Äô attention to get them to buy or do something often by using their data against them), worked in influencer marketing in its early days, and has now gone 180¬∫ to help to build a decentralized Internet by people and for people (where people are digitally sovereign), it really resonated with me.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
It‚Äôs commonly-discussed (see: The Social Dilemma) and quite obvious if you use or have used the Internet and specifically social media, that we are addicted to being online. In fact, we‚Äôre actually even chemically triggered by social media and other online experiences. Said Jeff Orlowski, director of The Social Dilemma, ‚ÄúSocial media powerhouses like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù to exploit users‚Äô brain chemistry in order to keep them glued to their phones‚Ä¶ They were designed to get us to come back. It‚Äôs to figure out how to reverse-engineer what we‚Äôre most vulnerable to, most susceptible to, to come back. And what we are seeing is a dopamine response in the brain.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In their article, Moskowitz points out how the Internet is¬†not just like a toxic relationship or junk food, where you can leave or stop yourself from eating, rather it‚Äôs ‚Äúan all-encompassing technology, our main economic engine, the tool we are forced to use to meet others and mediate our entire lives.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The truth is that the Internet &lt;em&gt;has&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; become more than an addiction, it‚Äôs become a necessity to keep up in today‚Äôs increasingly-digital world. Yet the Internet is not even accessible to about 40% of the global population ‚Äì and for those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; have access, it does not serve us. It‚Äôs actually the other way around. We are the product.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúWe produce the memes, tweets, posts, and pictures that keep us tethered to the internet, and then that¬†content is monetized¬†in the form of advertisements - revenue users help produce, but do not usually see a penny of,‚Äù says Moskowitz. We have become cogs in a machine that uses us for its own benefit. Or as they call¬†it, ‚Äúa factory we‚Äôre forced to work in without any pay.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúOur entire society has been reformulated around the internet, much like it was centered around the factory during the Industrial Revolution. If there‚Äôs an¬†Amazon Web Services outage, much of our society stops functioning. Without the internet, we couldn‚Äôt find jobs, or, at this point, even friends.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-do-we-do&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-do-we-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-do-we-do&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So, what do we do?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moskowitz is correct in their thinking when they say¬†the following, ‚ÄúA solution to our current internet-use crisis cannot come at an individual level anymore than one person quitting their job would solve capitalism‚Äôs poor working conditions. If we want any hope of making the internet less stressful, less back-breaking, and more fulfilling, content creators, gig economy workers, and even casual internet users need to push for a systemic solution.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Simply pending less time on the Internet or using certain apps instead of others is not going to make much of a difference in the end. There are billions of people on the Internet today to make up for the loss. And the underlying system is still massively flawed and can be manipulated. Bold, widespread, systemic change¬†is indeed what we need. A revolution, perhaps.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out recently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tgdaily.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;6-dfinity-threefold-are-leading-an-internet-decentralization-revolution&#x2F;&quot;&gt;in TGDaily&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold is that revolution.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold is the engine for a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Internet, driven by a movement of people who care about a better future. With more than two decades of direct knowledge of the Internet and Cloud industries, we flipped today‚Äôs Internet on its head. We rebuilt the architecture from the ground up, with people and our planet at the center of our focus. Instead of relying on centralized hyper-scale data centers owned by a few private corporations, we provide the opportunity for people across the world with access to a network connection and electricity to plug in hardware and provide local capacity, and earn income while they are at it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In our model, we prioritize simplicity, security, efficiency, and privacy. The technology runs autonomously, removing human error and malicious intent from the equation. Connections are peer-to-peer, meaning no middlemen get in the way of our content, our transactions, or other data. And importantly, people own their data. What we produce is ours. We decide where it gets stored and we decide who can access it (and for what value). In fact,¬†it‚Äôs basically impossible from a technical standpoint for anybody to access someone‚Äôs data without their consent ‚Äì including us.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
On top of the technology, we¬†provide experiences. People will have one single log-in and verifiable identity, and gain access to the tools (experiences) they need for communication and for work. As we are a decentralized movement, soon, anybody will be able to build anything they like on top of ThreeFold ‚Äì but it is our vision and belief¬†that the Internet should not be addictive. Rather a tool for all of humanity to connect, learn, and prosper ‚Äì with people at the center, not treated as products.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To the author‚Äôs concern, content creators and gig economy workers would clearly benefit from such a digital world as well. Of course services like Airbnb or Uber or Etsy or even YouTube provide value as they are crowded marketplaces both for providers and customers. That said, they profit from people, typically on both sides of the transaction. In a peer-to-peer world, we can create fair and equal marketplaces where the content or product is owned completely by the person listing it there and the value goes 100% directly from person to person. This means no hidden fees, no uncertainty over ownership, no censorship or control from a third party. Of course it‚Äôs not all predetermined at this moment, but what I can say is that our biggest concerns in what we create are and will always be fairness and equality (and sustainability &#x2F; regeneration). So, together, we will bring all of this tolife in the best interest of people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;join-the-movement&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#join-the-movement&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: join-the-movement&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Join the Movement&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their article, Moskowitz concluded that ‚Äúperhaps it is only a matter of time before enough of us say ‚Äòenough,‚Äô and protest the internet‚Äôs totalizing grasp on our labor and our lives.‚Äù But where does protest lead without a viable solution? Maybe this is the type of systemic change Moskowitz could imagine and could stand behind. It‚Äôs not a band-aid approach, rather a total¬†re-imagination and re-execution of today‚Äôs flawed and manipulative Internet. It‚Äôs an Internet by people, for people. Instead of working in the factory, we become the factory co-owners ‚Äì and the Internet works for us.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
If you believe in what we are building, we invite you to join the movement:

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚Äú‚Ä¶ The ThreeFold project is led by a 65-[person] team of disruptors with a common goal: to put sovereign control of the internet in everybody‚Äôs hand.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
It goes without saying that these visionaries desire a true democracy of the internet: an internet of the people, by the people and for all people everywhere.‚Äù

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/threefold-zetako/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For both Zetako and ThreeFold, efficiency and sustainability are key. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zetako.ai&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zetako&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a company dedicated to lossless data compression, and after years of research and development, has created an alternative solution to the regular standards of data compression. And with two decades of relevant experience and a focus on sustainability, ThreeFold has built new peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure and technologies from the ground up ‚Äì where every aspect is optimized towards maximum efficiency and the least amount of harm to the planet.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both already members of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;aci&quot;&gt;the Alliance for a Conscious Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a planetary movement of people and organizations that take action to shape a conscious digital world, Zetako and ThreeFold have now signed on to merge their technologies to bring forward hyper-efficient, secure, and private data transport and storage solutions for all.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúThe world has been using the same compression technology for the last 30 years, just like the model to deliver IT services has not changed,‚Äù says Weynand Kuijpers, ThreeFold Co-Founder. ‚ÄúThreeFold challenges that status quo, where anybody can now be¬†the Internet by adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì and with this, we need a 21st century compression and decompression technology.¬†Zetako delivers that much-needed true innovation.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold Grid is live today, the world‚Äôs most advanced peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. It can scale limitlessly, and brings a more performant, secure and sustainable Internet to host humanity‚Äôs data and workloads. ThreeFold technology already consumes 90 percent less energy than today‚Äôs solutions.¬†(The company has also recently announced plans to offset energy usage 100 percent by the end of 2021, with the goal of taking two times more carbon out of the air than they put in.)
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
With its quantum safe storage offering, ThreeFold can now integrate with Zetako‚Äôs technology to store compressed data, enabling it to become even more efficient and sustainable. Further, ThreeFold can now do compression live on network connections between different parts of what users deploy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúWe are particularly excited about the opportunity to work with ThreeFold as we believe they represent the future of data transmission &amp;amp; storage,‚Äù says Claus Rosenberg Gotthard, CEO of Zetako. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the right place to implement Zetako‚Äôs innovative technologies of bit-by-bit compression.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the short term, Zetako and ThreeFold will work on a project basis to fulfill specific organization requirements. Zetako provides the compression, and ThreeFold provides the compute and storage. As an example, with COVID-19 and the world moving increasingly digital, congesting the network, people and businesses that need a way to transfer large files quickly will now have a much more efficient way to do so. And in the longer term, the two will explore more ways to deeply integrate their technologies and provide broader solutions to the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-zetako&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-zetako&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-zetako&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About Zetako&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zetako is dedicated to reducing energy usage &amp;amp; CO2 emission for the transmission &amp;amp; storage of data by applying a new¬†more efficient lossless data compression technology.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We have developed a new mathematical theory based on Statistical Predictive modeling and applied this to a new lossless data compression technology. The result is a technology that provides higher Compression at higher Speed and uses &amp;gt;70% less energy in the process. In addition to this, the technology is capable of doing bit-by-bit compression allowing for real time bandwidth reduction. The technology does not need a prior knowledge of the dataset to start compression. This means that our technology does not require the data stream to be chopped up into chunks ‚Äì we apply compression the moment the first bit (1 or 0) comes in.

		<title>A Smart Contract for all IT workloads</title>
		<published>2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/smart-contract-blog/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/smart-contract-blog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold was inspired by the blockchain burst when it was created in 2016. After doing a comprehensive scan of the technological space we realized that Blockchain holds the best technology to store (1) Smart Contracts and (2) Transactions in an immutable way. We created our own blockchain database: Rivine to host the Smart Contract layer before switching to the Parity Substrate of Polkadot and our Transactional blockchain to the Stellar Network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While we use blockchain technology, ThreeFold is much more than just ‚Äúa blockchain project‚Äù as we apply many more revolutionary technologies. We decided to use Parity Substrate as we don‚Äôt see the need to create something if there‚Äôs already great technologies out there that we can already use. Today we‚Äôre proud of our Smart Contract for IT layer and approach the ThreeFold Grid v3.0 release this year which will expose its full potential to interact with the primitives of the grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is this Smart Contract for IT about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smart Contract for IT allows you, your company or your community to execute the storage and running of your files and applications securely with consensus and automatic billing. You could compare it as a fingerprint check and your data would be accessible only if presenting your private key (fingerprint). Let‚Äôs maybe go through the process for a better idea of how this works.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The smart contracts are like recipes for chefs to cook exactly what you want. In that sense they need to be very accurate and as descriptive as possible to deliver what you need. In the case of ThreeFold, the smart contracts would define different sets of Internet resources you would need to store files, run applications, or communicate across the network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Whenever you want to reserve more resources to store your latest album or run your applications, you will define the resources you need to your 3Bot or Digital Twin (your personal virtual system administrators) which will then look at different smart contracts that are available and choose the most appropriate package. For e.g. Reserve 3 PB of Storage in Switzerland across 7 nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Following that, your 3Bot or Digital Twin will create and register the smart contract in the blockchain database in a few seconds, providing you with all your specific needs. It will also store and secure some instructions to the BCDB for the nodes to meet smart contract completion. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold had to make sure that user data would remain ultra-secure. Inspired by storage and communication algorithms used in space, we integrated it between the Smart Contract layer and Zero OS. The algorithm splits data into unrecognizable ‚Äòslices‚Äô that are distributed via network connections to different nodes locally or across the world, and that can be reconstructed only with your fingerprint. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;More than the average Smart Contract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via your Smart Contract for IT, you can also define a consensus mechanism and create multi-signatures for smart contract execution or completion to deliver appropriate digital services in for example work related activities. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The beauty of the Smart Contract for IT is that it can work with thousands of connected nodes for the proper execution of any digital requirements on the infrastructure, verify if consensus was reached or not, download the right files to execute the smart contract and verify them, make sure that no hacker or outsider can ever gain access or influence its execution and more.

		<title>A Scalable and Secure Operating System</title>
		<published>2021-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/zero-os-blog/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/zero-os-blog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just like a brain is an interconnected network of neurons, the Internet (or internet) is a global interconnected network of computers and devices that communicate with each other via the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_protocol_suite&quot;&gt;Internet protocol suite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TCP&#x2F;IP). The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To create a new Internet from scratch, ThreeFold had to start at the operating system (OS) level. An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. And this is how Zero OS was born &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-zero-os-special&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-makes-zero-os-special&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-makes-zero-os-special&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What makes Zero OS special?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero OS is a stateless and lightweight operating system. Given it has no shell, remote or server interface, it is much safer than the big majority of the OSs on the market. When storing your data on Zero OS, it is fingerprinted and made available only when requested by you or those you provide access to.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The state of an application represents its state of being in a given moment in time. Think of a stateless transaction as vending machines, a single request and a response. In ThreeFold‚Äôs Internet infrastructure, this can be represented as data being accessible only when requested. 
The only way to access data on Zero OS is via the private key (or fingerprint) of a user. In that sense, the data is not accessible unless the data owner requests access to it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does Zero OS apply to developers?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its lightweight architecture, Zero OS is a perfect fit to run microservice architectures and emerging IT workloads such as IoT, Blockchains, Big Data, and more. A key benefit of microservice architecture is the freedom it offers you to choose the best runtime for the task at hand. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Let‚Äôs take the example of decentralizing service-oriented developing teams. A common challenge there is that most of the time they don‚Äôt really understand the applications they are exposing. But no one knows the data infrastructure of the applications better than those who craft them. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold permits decentralized developer teams with the ability to share keys (access) to the developing environment on Zero OS and the gateways to the world wide web within the secure peer-to-peer overlay network. This is game changing. Also with all the automation frameworks provided, it creates the perfect environment to develop current and emerging technologies. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Put shortly, decentralized development and integration is now officially an organizational or cultural change, not a technical one anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zero OS allows anyone to provide sovereign capacity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given stateless systems separate the OS configuration and user data, Zero OS simplifies the  maintenance and the deployment of digital workloads, while making it impossible to hack into user data on a hardware level. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
3Nodes provide all the storage, compute and network primitives for a new internet infrastructure. Given they are booted with Zero OS, anyone can now participate in the Internet economy without jeopardizing user data sovereignty and security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Conclusively, Zero OS is ultra secure, perfect to develop current and future technologies, and enables anyone to take part in the planet positive and data sovereign Internet brought by ThreeFold.

		<title>ThreeFold‚Äôs Planet Positive Plan</title>
		<published>2021-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no question that climate change is one of the biggest, if not the biggest threats facing humanity today. If we care at all about future generations and the health of our planet, we have no choice but to address these threats, and fast. That‚Äôs why one of our biggest aims is to lower the energy usage of our digital lives. But ThreeFold is taking not just a sustainable approach, we‚Äôre setting the plan for a planet positive Internet.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Recently, we released information on how our infrastructure saves up-to-90% on energy consumption compared to existing models. We achieve this mainly thanks to an extremely efficient storage system and the concept of a Digital Twin.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
From &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_storage&quot;&gt;a storage standpoint&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we reduce energy by avoiding copies, implementing a multi-layer system, not using fast disks, through read&#x2F;write caching, and more. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_digital_twin&quot;&gt;Digital Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we have taken a very different approach to how we exist in today‚Äôs digital world. Rather than existing 100 times in a huge system of client-server architecture, now we exist only once. We believe that we can run 25 Digital Twins with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__bulb_comparison_twin&quot;&gt;the same energy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as used by one light bulb.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Saving energy is one thing, but there will still be remaining energy. This needs to be offset by carbon credits. Now, in order to regenerate our planet, we &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__carbon_negative&quot;&gt;work together with Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to let students farm carbon credits. This has the potential to offset energy usage 100% by the end of 2021, and we have, as an aim to take 2x more carbon out of the air than we put in.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our planet needs better solutions across industries. No more talking. Now is the time to act.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>TFT is more accessible; now available via PancakeSwap and a BTC Integration on ThreeFold Connect</title>
		<published>2021-05-12T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/tft-bsc-btc/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, we announced &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoinist.com&#x2F;peer-to-peer-internet-threefold-goes-multichain-to-accelerate-token-accessibility&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our plans to go ‚Äúmultichain,‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; bringing the ThreeFold Token (TFT) to three popular DeFi ecosystems: Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Huobi‚Äôs ECO Chain. Today, the bridge to BSC is now live, and TFT is available on PancakeSwap!
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By making TFT more accessible, more of the world is now able to take part in the growth of a peer-to-peer Internet owned by all of us. Members of the ThreeFold community, DeFi enthusiasts, and the Binance community now have another way to access TFT, and can swap it with other BSC-based tokens as they wish.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As an added bonus, today we are also pleased to share that anyone can now buy TFT with BTC directly on the ThreeFold Connect app.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-threefold-all-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-threefold-all-about&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-threefold-all-about&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is ThreeFold all about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is a quantum-safe peer-to-peer Internet (storage and compute), combining a stateless operating system with autonomous technology on a globally-distributed network of nodes. The technology stack is unstoppable (self-driving and self-healing) and our tamper-proof infrastructure can scale with demand.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Reputed organizations and blockchains (e.g. DigiByte, Polygon, CasperLabs) are joining the ThreeFold ecosystem, as it is best positioned to efficiently and truly decentralize the web through its advanced technology stack.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;token&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the official currency of ThreeFold, with each token representing a unit of reservation of capacity (storage and compute) on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farming&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With TFT, developers and enterprises can reserve compute and storage to build any IT workload and application on the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Now is the best time for anyone to join ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralization movement, as we‚Äôre on the verge of releasing the next generation Internet and Cloud to mainnet, through a sequence of events starting next month.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;making-it-easier-to-get-tft&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#making-it-easier-to-get-tft&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: making-it-easier-to-get-tft&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Making it easier to get TFT&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BSC dApp and DeFi ecosystem has grown significantly over the last few months. In April, it was reported that BSC held up to 9 million transactions per day, outperforming Ethereum‚Äôs with (under) 2 million. Further, we have witnessed ongoing innovation in this particular environment, with multiple DeFi, Yield Farming, NFT applications, and other dApps leveraging the Binance Smart Chain and its cost-effective transactions. BSC is making DeFi applications more inclusive and accessible for people around the globe.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Beyond just making TFT more accessible, ThreeFold integrated with Binance Smart Chain to empower BSC developers with its decentralized storage and compute infrastructure. They can now benefit from ThreeFold‚Äôs peer-to-peer nature and autonomous IT, with more security, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and decentralization benefits.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
PancakeSwap has become the top Automated Market Maker (AMM) and Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on BSC. Multiple people in the ThreeFold community have requested to have the ability to leverage PancakeSwap‚Äôs platform¬†‚Äì to easily swap other BSC tokens for TFT, and to utilize its yield farming and other functionalities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;ultimately-the-bsc-integration-brings-forward-two-major-opportunities&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#ultimately-the-bsc-integration-brings-forward-two-major-opportunities&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: ultimately-the-bsc-integration-brings-forward-two-major-opportunities&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Ultimately, the BSC integration brings forward two major opportunities:&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes TFT more widely accessible, via one of the top smart chains in the world
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/threefold-dragonchain/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dragonchain and ThreeFold share a common mission of providing developers and the digital world with a more inclusive and decentralized Internet infrastructure ‚Äì one where data flows and is stored in a peer-to-peer environment, and where applications are computed by decentralized and community-owned protocols.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, Dragonchain and ThreeFold are proud to announce their partnership to further empower developers and enterprises around the world to build scalable dApps on Dragonchain, on ThreeFold‚Äôs peer-to-peer cloud.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold presents a more cost-effective, distributed, autonomous, secure, and sustainable alternative to centralized cloud-providers. Now, developers and enterprises building Web3 applications can leverage and deploy Dragonchain‚Äôs Blockchain and advanced smart-contracts into their dApps, with the added benefit of utilizing ThreeFold to completely decentralize their cloud computing infrastructure ‚Äì and deploy their solutions on the edge.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold‚Äôs peer-to-peer environment combined with the Dragonchain ecosystem gives communities the ability to build their online presence without worrying about censorship over dissenting opinions, local outages, or unauthorized access to data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúIt has alway been our belief that developers should have the freedom to build without restraint. We‚Äôre happy to partner with ThreeFold to provide the tools necessary to easily build applications for a decentralized environment,‚Äù Joe Roets, Chief Architect, Founder, CEO at Dragonchain.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Together, Dragonchain and ThreeFold are decreasing friction and opening more avenues for inclusion. The Dragonchain platform contains sophisticated and lightweight SDKs and enables enterprises to use their existing IT staff to deploy code in any coding language. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Further, the Dragonchain developer community can now build Web3-native and P2P cloud-native applications without the need for prior Blockchain experience. Developers now have access to scalable industry-standard solutions like Docker, Kubernetes, S3 storage ‚Äì and ThreeFold‚Äôs Quantum Safe Filesystem ‚Äì to build applications for a decentralized environment. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As stated by Weynand Kuijipers, co-founder at ThreeFold, ‚ÄúdApps need to live outside the market-leading monopolies and we are proud to be able to provide secure, private and sovereign compute and storage capacity for the Dragonchain community.‚Äú
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Both ThreeFold and Dragonchain invite and support any and all Web2 and Web3 developers to build decentralized applications that have the potential to change the world and make it a better and more inclusive place for us all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is developing a peer-to-peer Internet platform that aims to liberalize what it labels as a centralized and unequally distributed Internet. Its platform, called the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__grid_home&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, comprises over +600 servers in 25+ different countries around the world, delivering approximately 80 PB in storage and over 16,000 CPU cores worldwide, making it the largest storage and compute peer-to-peer Internet network in the world. See ThreeFold Grid‚Äôs statistics in more detail using their explorer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.threefold.io&#x2F;all&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each server runs ThreeFold‚Äôs stateless and lightweight open-source operating system, Zero-OS, and is set up and operated by independent individuals and organizations called Farmers. Farmers earn rewards in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__token_home&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; - the platform‚Äôs native token - for their participation. TFT is the currency of the ThreeFold Grid, with each token representing a unit of storage and compute on the platform. Grid users can use these tokens to reserve the storage and compute they need to store, build and share on the platform‚Äôs internet network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold‚Äôs ultimate vision is to be part of the movement to fully democratize the Internet worldwide.

		<title>CasperLabs and ThreeFold Join Forces</title>
		<published>2021-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/casperlabs-threefold/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/casperlabs-threefold/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CasperLabs and ThreeFold have a shared belief that decentralization is needed in order to build a better tomorrow. According to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casperlabs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;company&quot;&gt;CasperLabs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, decentralization is ‚Äúhow we will create more open, transparent, permissionless networks powered by people ‚Äî paving the way for a new era of equitable innovation.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, ThreeFold is thrilled to announce a collaborative partnership with CasperLabs. Together, we will further CasperLabs‚Äô decentralization efforts while accelerating a collective mission and vision of more equally distributing global wealth and resources ‚Äì doing so through creating more opportunity for people and enterprises around the world, without limits.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThreeFold and CasperLabs share a commitment to making web3 environments more accessible to all developers,‚Äù says Neil Kapoor of CasperLabs. ‚ÄúNow that Casper is live on mainnet, we look forward to collaborating with ThreeFold to deliver a truly scalable, secure and decentralized IT infrastructure for enterprise organizations building innovative, blockchain-based solutions.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the partnership, developers and enterprises building on top of Casper technology will be able to choose to run on ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;cloud&quot;&gt;Peer-to-Peer Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for storage and compute resources. This will enable them to achieve security and scalability beyond what the centralized cloud providers can offer today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
On a smaller scale, anyone will be able to contribute to Casper‚Äôs blockchain security, resiliency, scalability and decentralization, by deploying a Casper Validator node on the ThreeFold Grid in just a few clicks. The ThreeFold deployment mechanism removes all technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From ThreeFold co-founder Adnan Fatayerji, ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited about our partnership with CasperLabs. Their platform is designed with simplicity and scale to drive global adoption amongst enterprises and developers. ThreeFold fits perfectly as a decentralized substrate (storage and compute) to provide all Casper customers with a truly decentralized, secure, and scalable alternative to current cloud providers.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the¬†distributed computer application architecture where tasks and workloads are shared between peers, popularized by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a revolutionary file storing system from the late 1990s.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The concept inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P systems and groups are typically critical of authoritarian and centralized social structures and believe in equality, meritocracy, flat systems, participatory &amp;amp; circular economies, as the concept represents a concrete pathway to these outcomes or visions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
P2P systems are¬†network, not¬†linear or ‚Äòpyramidal‚Äô hierarchies (though they may share some elements). They are ‚Äòdistributed‚Äô, though they may have elements of ‚Äòcentralization‚Äô and ‚Äòdecentralization.‚Äô And intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does ThreeFold relate to peer-to-peer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs Peer-to-Peer¬†(P2P) computing network¬†is a distributed architecture that splits tasks and workloads between its¬†peers, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;what_is_farming&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Farmers are equal¬†participants in the network and together they form a peer-to-peer network of nodes, the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Farmers make¬†their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Farmers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional¬†&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Client-server&quot;&gt;client-server&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;¬†model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the near future, ThreeFold will create Digital Twin, which will go¬†beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources. It will actually enable much more than that. Digital Twin will create a complete new digital world with diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a¬†&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtual_community&quot;&gt;virtual community&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;¬†on the ThreeFold Grid. This will empower the network of peers¬†to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, and are beneficial to all the peers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why did ThreeFold choose peer-to-peer?¬†&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything starts (or should start) from the why, and the ThreeFold story started a long time ago. Before the inception of ThreeFold, many of the co-founders of the project used to work with the largest IT &amp;amp; Cloud actors. Throughout their experience working in the Industry, they realized that the complexity of the technology and the centralization of knowledge &amp;amp; power led to an inefficient, unsustainable, not scalable and unequally distributed infrastructure. So they decided to redesign the whole Internet and cloud infrastructure bottom-up with the vision of shaping a global internet economy that can scale anywhere efficiently, cost efficiently and sustainably.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why does the world needs peer-to-peer?¬†&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing the technology, the conviction that peer-to-peer was the best solution for humanity and the planet strengthened itself. Why? Well, put simply, a peer-to-peer system removes all forms of intermediaries, unnecessary steps and complexity from the picture. Therefore, it simplifies the architecture in an incredible way. The benefits are many but here are the most popular benefits:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Privacy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Our peer-to-peer environment means no middlemen or intermediaries, meaning data travels¬†directly between peers and stored on the nodes of their choice¬†rather than being sent through and stored by a third party.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Data stored in data centers is susceptible to security breaches. In bypassing data centers and exchanging data directly between peers, we can achieve much greater security as it reduces code and back doors significantly.¬†&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: In a many-to-many system, scale is essentially unlimited. There is simply no bottleneck. And hardware (nodes) can be added at ease compared to current data center model.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost-efficiency &amp;amp; Sustainability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: End-to-end (direct) connection between peers means a more efficient path for data and less energy is needed. Less energy means less cost, and less harm to our planet.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;In 2021 the world is going peer-to-peer!¬†&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre now in 4 years into the project, and it is clear that ThreeFold holds the most advanced technology and is probably the only tech company in the world that can achieve¬†a peer-to-peer network &amp;amp; digital world as envisioned by the concept authors. The ThreeFold Grid is running and already at it‚Äôs 2.4 version and 2021 will bring various commercial opportunities for the public to partake in the peer-to-peer network, from hosting IT workloads to experiencing P2P end-user solutions. In other words, in 2021, the world will be able to go peer-to-peer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Privacy and decentralization are some of the values shared by both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.presearch.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Presearch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, at the core of their missions to create scalable technologies that can positively impact the lives of millions of individuals and enterprises around the globe.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch and ThreeFold are thrilled to officially announce their collaborative partnership. Presearch is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearch.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a community-powered, decentralized search engine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that provides better results while protecting your privacy and rewarding you when you search. And ThreeFold is the world‚Äôs largest peer-to-peer cloud, bringing privacy and security, cost-efficiencies, ease-of-use, and true IT decentralization to the market.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch (and its node and storage infrastructure) will benefit from ThreeFold‚Äôs peer-to-peer cloud in two different ways:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;1. Powering Presearch node operators with a decentralized cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Presearch community will be able to deploy their Presearch nodes in a few clicks in a completely decentralized cloud infrastructure, using the ThreeFold peer-to-peer cloud and its developer tools. Thus, they can escape the monopolies of centralized cloud providers, and reduce the technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Colin Pape, Presearch‚Äôs CEO, said in a statement, ‚ÄúWe are excited to partner with the ThreeFold team to offer our community members an easy way to quickly deploy Presearch Nodes on ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid, the world‚Äôs largest server network powered by blockchain technology.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch has recently opened its beta testing program for node operators looking to become part of the revolutionary network that is changing the way individuals around the world can search the web ‚Äì in a significantly more private, inclusive, and rewarding environment. Anyone who believes in the decentralization of search engines should &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearchcommunity.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;UkDumktm&quot;&gt;sign up to their beta testers list&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and get in touch with Presearch to be one of the early adopters. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;2. Leveraging ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized storage to store the future of the search engine experience&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presearch and ThreeFold are exploring the usage of ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized storage capacity to store and archive Presearch‚Äôs indexes and other data running the search engine. The main goal is to provide an unbreakable data storage and backup infrastructure for the future of the search engine experience that the top-notch team behind Presearch is building.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition, ThreeFold looks forward to advocating for Presearch and integrating the decentralized search engine into its current and future solutions for a more private and inclusive internet experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Powering the ThreeFold community‚Äôs search engine experience with Presearch&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold will be establishing Presearch‚Äôs decentralized search engine as its main search engine partner, advocating for its usage within its growing community of developers, cloud capacity farmers, enterprises, and users. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As stated by Weynand Kuijpers, ‚ÄúPresearch is creating a search engine by people for people. The internet has moved from data sharing to centralized data harvesting. Presearch is undoing that by creating user control over data stored, presenting a (digital) return for contributing to the system and improving search results, and making it decentralized. ThreeFold is looking forward to co-creating a decentralized mechanism where the search engine is broken down and operates everywhere, and users are in control of their own identity and data.‚Äú
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
More to come as the partnership develops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-presearch&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About Presearch:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are tired of Big Tech companies dominating the internet, censoring content and controlling the social narrative by manipulating information to fit an agenda. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch provides improved access to information and increased search choice with its community-driven search engine that leverages blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to empower and reward users. More than 1.6 million people have already joined the service.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In 2020, Presearch launched its innovative keyword staking sponsorship platform that enables promoters to lock their Presearch PRE cryptocurrency tokens against different keywords in order to have their promotional ads displayed. More than 60 million PRE tokens have already been locked.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Now Presearch is launching a decentralized search engine that rewards node operators with PRE tokens when they run Presearch nodes. Through its partnership with ThreeFold, anyone will be able to easily launch a Presearch node running on the ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid with no technical knowledge required.

&lt;p&gt;Classic IT infrastructure setup is complex and is not cost-effective. Applications need a specific environment to operate in, built by integrating different technology components from different vendors. Elements of such a setup are operating systems, storage systems, networks, security systems, authentication systems, and more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Putting components together is called (system) integration, and integration requires agreement on how these components will fit together and the knowledge to do it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This complexity and need for integration originate from the way the IT industry historically developed. With time more and more layers appeared to bring new possibilities. Additional layers masked existing problems. Instead of fixing the underlying issues, several third parties needed to be involved, adding complexity and increased costs (such as license costs, upgrades, updates, etc.). Complexity has become a business model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Where can we get inspiration to do it a different way?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we could build IT architectures in a different way.  What if we would not accept component solution approaches anymore and start over with a completely blank sheet of paper?  Would we then come up with a different way of actually building automation, architectures, and business models?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-at-nature-for-inspiration&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#looking-at-nature-for-inspiration&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: looking-at-nature-for-inspiration&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Looking at nature for inspiration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start by looking for inspiration in nature. Suppose we consider IT systems to be a complex system. Are there parallels that we can draw between systems that exist in nature (and have evolved and improved over thousands of years) and those within the IT industry?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In nature, we see two kinds of systems (societies): centralized and decentralized systems.  Examples of centralized systems are herds, groups, or schools of animals living together where there is a hierarchy in the way they organize themselves. For decentralized systems, we can look at beehives and anthills.  Organizing efforts and benefits are distinct and come at a different cost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;centralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#centralized-systems-in-nature&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: centralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Centralized systems in nature&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In centralized systems, there is governance of activities, wealth positions, and so forth.  Think of a group of lions or chimpanzees.  There is always an alpha male who is dominant in the whole group.  He is the only that enjoys all of the benefits because the entire group&#x2F;structure works towards his wishes.  He gets to mate with most female group members because the system believes that he has the strongest genes to help the group to survive in the future. The dominant male also gets most of the food gathered by the group, and if he doesn‚Äôt get it, he will claim it by showing his dominance and fight for it.  All the others are working towards this alpha male, and all the other males in the group will occasionally challenge the alpha male for dominance.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This is very similar to how the IT industry has been operating to date:  there are a few alpha males in the industry - one for each sector that can be recognized (for example, in the Cloud Industry, you have Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and on the system integration front you have Dell, Siemens, CA Technologies).  They end up with the majority of businesses available in their specific markets. When challenged by new companies, they fight them (in every way possible, including killing them or acquiring them). And in analogy to the animal group, these alpha male companies have a lot of organizations that work with them, usually called ‚Äúpartners‚Äù or ‚Äúchannels.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralized-systems-in-nature&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralized systems in nature&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decentralized systems on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decentralised_system&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we learn; ‚ÄúOne of the most well-known examples of a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù decentralized system is one used by insect colonies such as Ants. In these insect colonies, control is distributed among the biological agents who act upon local information and local interactions to create complex and universal behavior collectively. While individually exhibiting simple behaviors, these agents achieve universal goals such as feeding the colony or raising the brood using dynamical mechanisms like non-explicit communication and exploiting their closely coupled action and perception systems. Without any form of central authority, these insect colonies achieve their universal goals by performing required tasks and by responding to changing conditions in their external environment. They also adjust the number of workers performing each task to ensure the completion of all tasks. For example, ant colonies guide their global behavior (in terms of foraging, patrolling, brood care, and nest maintenance) using a pulsing, shifting web of Spatio-temporal patterned interactions that rely on antennal contact rate and olfactory sensing. While these interactions consist of both interactions with the environment and each other, ants do not direct the behavior of other ants. They thus never have a ‚Äúcentral controller‚Äù dictating what is to be done to achieve global goals.‚Äú
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So nature has provided us with solid examples of centralized and decentralized systems.  For much of what works in the modern world, we have ended up using the centralized model governing enterprises and countries.  Various industries have also adopted the centralized model where there is a pyramid structure, and everything works towards the alpha males.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A different approach to creating and operating IT workloads&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we can develop a new concept for creating, deploying, and operating IT workloads.  What if we say goodbye to the centralized way of controlling IT workloads.  Can we develop an idea that works in a decentralized way?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-concept&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-concept&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-concept&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The concept&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build this concept, we will draw the use of the human way of operating a large ship. The crew of a vessel has different roles, which we will call the &lt;em&gt;coordinators&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Some of these coordinators could be a captain, officers, engineers, and oilers.  These coordinators have in-depth knowledge of their specific tasks but usually lack a detailed understanding of the other roles. In the ‚Äúhive‚Äù of a ship, the specific requests to get tasks done are sent to coordinators who will receive, interpret, execute their particular tasks, and report the (non-) progress of these tasks or subtasks.  For example, the captain will create and agree to a schedule of maintenance tasks for the engine room. These are daily, weekly and monthly tasks that should be completed by the engineers and oilers. The engineers and oilers do not get continuous input from the captain. They get one instruction to follow the schedule and know what needs to be done for every task. The intermediate state (what is complete and what still needs to be addressed) is stored by the coordinators executing the tasks. This is the most efficient way of accomplishing tasks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jumping-to-the-it-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#jumping-to-the-it-industry&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: jumping-to-the-it-industry&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Jumping to the IT industry&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we bring this concept to the IT world, we conclude that today‚Äôs IT systems are built in a significantly different way.  Most architectures (if not all) have a central facility that stores &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; information and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; states of activity in a so-called central ‚Äòdatabase.‚Äô A general norm within IT. However, these types of architectures are inefficient and are very complex - like the ship analogy -  a central command room (database) is created where every coordinator needs to report back. (1) The current level of activity, (2) the completion (state) of tasks, (3) the proper understanding of upcoming tasks by the coordinator to accomplish tasks in-progress or future - hence leading to the undesirable outcome of complexity due to centralization. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the ship example, we deem this type of functioning&#x2F;workflow inefficient; however, in the IT world, it is a common way of doing it.  Furthermore, IT infrastructures usually have different databases to store ‚Äústate‚Äù in different parts of the IT architecture.  The analogy would translate to different command rooms that orchestrate different functions on the ship in our ship. This, in turn, introduces the need for another role in starting coordinating between the different command rooms to ensure that all information is shared and communicated. Taking this pattern forward leads to an endless loop of adding interfaces, layers, bridges between different parts of the system that all store information, multiple times, and in different ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;datastores&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#datastores&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: datastores&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Datastores&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By design, a decentralized IT  architecture should not use centralized data storage (databases) for multiple tasks (roles). It instead should feature a similar approach to the way of functioning as in the ‚Äòship‚Äô example. In this architecture,  roles get short and precise instructions of the jobs to be completed and autonomously execute.  We call these execution engines &lt;em&gt;coordinators&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.  Coordinators receive instructions, run on instructions and store all information about the current task &lt;em&gt;locally.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;  They store all the relevant information in a local storage facility (available to the individual coordinators only) and provide information about the state of execution if and when other coordinators ask for a state update.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify common IT architectures, we should look at a   new way of creating such a system that takes the current standards into account:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No people involved in integrating different components into a single solution&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which, as a consequence, means no revenue generation based on creating and managing complexity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No central state &#x2F; operational data storage&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual automated actors with specific knowledge for specific tasks&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent operating actors completing specific tasks
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Such a system should ideally be owned by many (not just a single organization, bringing centralization back into the equations) that operate IT tasks for many.  We have not seen such a system in existence, but we are as TFTech building and rolling out technology that can do this.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe that IT‚Äôs future is in decentralization where specific coordinators (bots) will roam a network of capacity looking for a task to do, making themselves available where needed, creating more of them when the system grows, and allowing the global population to deploy and operate IT workloads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dash is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with a strong focus on the payments industry. Dash offers a form of money that is portable, inexpensive, divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and in-person with only minimal transaction fees. Based on the Bitcoin project, Dash aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments system in the world.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bitcoin‚Äôs feature set, Dash currently also offers instant transactions (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dash.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;introduction&#x2F;features.html#instantsend&quot;&gt;InstantSend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), private transactions (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dash.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;introduction&#x2F;features.html#privatesend&quot;&gt;PrivateSend&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and operates a self-governing and self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses for work that adds value to the network. This &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.dash.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;stable&#x2F;governance&#x2F;index.html#governance&quot;&gt;decentralized governance and budgeting system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes it one of the first ever successful decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harmony.one&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Its protocol has achieved secure and random state sharding, being the first sharded Proof of Stake on production. Harmony‚Äôs Mainnet supports thousands of nodes in multiple shards, producing blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The network‚Äôs staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing. Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism for network security and economics - Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) which reduces centralization and distributes rewards fairly to thousands of validators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;grid_why&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;‚Äôs peer-to-peer nature comes with many advantages for blockchains as it truly decentralizes their IT infrastructures and, enabling better performance, security, affordability, and sustainability, as compared to current centralized cloud alternatives.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tomochain.com&quot;&gt;TomoChain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will invite their developer community and anyone interested in contributing to the TomoChain Blockchain, to connect and use the Threefold Grid. By deploying their Masternodes and workloads on the ThreeFold Grid, their developers will benefit from a more decentralized and affordable cloud offering and benefit from the autonomous execution of their workloads via ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;#&#x2F;smart_contract&quot;&gt;Smart Contract for IT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Anyone interested in being part of the TomoChain node ecosystem using the ThreeFold Grid would be highly encouraged to get started in a few steps &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;setting-up-a-tomochain-node-in-5-steps&#x2F;389&quot;&gt;following the documentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Furthermore, with the recent announcement of TomoChain‚Äôs DEX Protocol, TomoX, released, both organizations will also test the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;#&#x2F;intro&quot;&gt;ThreeFold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solution to enable developers to build DEXs on top of TomoChain using ThreeFold‚Äôs truly decentralized IT infrastructure.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold has developed the largest and most advanced peer-to-peer Internet grid in the world.  They launched the ThreeFold Grid V2.0 in  April 2020 - a  more performant, private &amp;amp; secure, affordable, and sustainable solution than centralized cloud and internet providers. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
With a collective and incentivized ecosystem of Farmers (independent Internet capacity providers) around the globe, the ThreeFold Grid is now open for developers to build on top of it and benefit from all the advantages that comes with it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold Foundation aims to empower a more equal, autonomous (decentralized) and sustainable world, and does so  by providing the necessary peer-to-peer technologies and infrastructure to the world, while incentivizing growth in developing regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<updated>2020-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/how-it-works/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/how-it-works/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-why&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-why&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-why&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So, ThreeFold is building a new internet. Why?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe that a new internet is needed for our planet and for humanity. ‚ÄúIf not now, when? If not us, who?‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
What it boils down to is that currently the internet is only available to about 1&#x2F;2 of the world (meaning billions are being left behind), it is centralized (a handful of large corporations own and profit off of our data), and it uses up to 10% of the world‚Äôs energy consumption. So, we‚Äôre building a new (peer-to-peer) internet that empowers equality (access), autonomy (data ownership, for example), and sustainability (reduces energy consumption). These values drive us forward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-it-work&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does it work?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything on the internet ‚Äì websites, apps, photos, videos, etc ‚Äì uses up capacity and is stored in huge data centers owned by big companies, mainly in North America, Europe, and some in Asia. In our solution, centralized data centers are replaced with a grid of ‚Äúnodes‚Äù distributed around the world.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
These nodes are owned by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;what_is_farming&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ‚Äì but only the physical hardware ‚Äì the data inside of the nodes belongs to the people or organizations who put it there. So, ‚Äúfarmers‚Äù plug in hardware and start to create capacity that can be used by people.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Farmers come in all shapes and sizes. Some farmers run small data centers while others simply run a node out of their living room.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
When Farmers connect active hardware (add capacity) to the ThreeFold Grid, ThreeFold Tokens are created. Farmers can then sell those tokens to people who want to use capacity (e.g. a developer that wants to build or host a website, or a person who wants to store some photos). More on tokens down below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;seems-quite-lofty-how-will-you-build-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#seems-quite-lofty-how-will-you-build-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: seems-quite-lofty-how-will-you-build-it&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Seems quite lofty. How will you build it?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs true that rebuilding the internet is not so simple. But a lot of infrastructure has already been built and the technology is quite advanced. Over the past 2+ years (as of May 2020), independent ThreeFold Farmers have already plugged in more than 40,000,000 GigaBytes worth of storage and 15,000 CPU Cores across 21+ countries. That might not mean a lot to non-technical folks but it is quite a significant amount.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;21-countries-what-happened-to-equality&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#21-countries-what-happened-to-equality&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 21-countries-what-happened-to-equality&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;21+ countries? What happened to equality?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far along as we are, we still have work to do. One of our biggest goals in the near future is to expand the grid to Africa, South America, and parts of Asia where currently the Internet is too expensive or not available. Currently, we farming is incentivized around these key geographies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-what-do-you-mean-by-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#and-what-do-you-mean-by-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: and-what-do-you-mean-by-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;And what do you mean by peer-to-peer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer means no middlemen ‚Äì direct exchange of information and&#x2F;or value between equal participants. Peer-to-peer means decentralization ‚Äì breaking away from pyramid-based systems, greed-based systems ‚Äì and putting &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; back in the center of their own (digital) lives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-can-i-access-use-your-internet-today-what-can-i-do-on-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-how-can-i-access-use-your-internet-today-what-can-i-do-on-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-how-can-i-access-use-your-internet-today-what-can-i-do-on-it&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So how can I access &#x2F; use your internet today? What can I do on it?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By June, some of the first experiences will be live. This includes file storage and communication tools and a virtual browser, all with the advantages of being more sustainable for our planet and with full control of your own data. And over time, more and more experiences will come to this internet. We‚Äôll be updating here and on our communication platforms as they come. But don‚Äôt worry, as a user it doesn‚Äôt change much ‚Äì no coding required. :)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;will-enter-website-or-app-here-be-available-on-your-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#will-enter-website-or-app-here-be-available-on-your-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: will-enter-website-or-app-here-be-available-on-your-internet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Will [enter website or app here] be available on your internet?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some tremendous reasons for a website or app to use our internet, but that will really be up to the website or the app. In the end, we are providing a responsible solution for responsible people and organizations. We would love to host anybody who believes in what we are doing!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-are-you-making-sure-it-s-safe&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-are-you-making-sure-it-s-safe&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-are-you-making-sure-it-s-safe&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How are you making sure it‚Äôs safe?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hacking has become a part of life and is almost impossible to avoid in the current systems ‚Äì they are too complex and require too many people to operate. This results in less security which results in lots of security breaches. We took a look at the existing Internet (seven layers) and simplified it down to three layers. By simplifying the architecture and instead creating technology that is self-driving &amp;amp; self-healing, we removed the human requirement and therefore vastly minimized the possibility for hacking or human error. Then we also developed a storage algorithm which makes it such that if some of the information gets lost or stolen (somehow) or if some hardware goes down, it is all retrievable. Long story short, we flipped the existing system on its head.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-about-the-data-ownership-part&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-about-the-data-ownership-part&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-about-the-data-ownership-part&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What about the data ownership part?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That has a bit to do with the security as well. Since you own your data, you decide who gets access. Which means your data isn‚Äôt just out ‚Äúthere‚Äù for the taking. Basically, we put you at the center of your digital life, where the applications and experiences you use serve you, not the other way around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-how-is-it-better-for-the-planet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#and-how-is-it-better-for-the-planet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: and-how-is-it-better-for-the-planet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;And how is it better for the planet?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for us being more sustainable. Data centers are super unsustainable, so the simple (but incomplete) answer is ‚Äúno more huge data centers.‚Äù But if you want more detail:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use up to 3x less hardware for the same output, and using hardware at least 2x longer while maintaining good performance&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having capacity everywhere, local to where users are ‚Äì this reduces network requirements (and can even improve security)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using new algorithms (e.g. the one mentioned above for storage) which have dramatic efficiency improvement&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-using hardware where possible ‚Äì let‚Äôs not throw away&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-much-will-it-cost&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-much-will-it-cost&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-much-will-it-cost&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How much will it cost?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we want to provide sustainable access to the internet and all of its solutions for less than a dollar per month per person but for now the cost will depend on what you choose to do. Certain experiences will cost money. Storing photos or videos, for example. But all at a fair price.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;speaking-of-money-so-what-s-up-with-the-threefold-token&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#speaking-of-money-so-what-s-up-with-the-threefold-token&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: speaking-of-money-so-what-s-up-with-the-threefold-token&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Speaking of money ‚Äì so what‚Äôs up with the ThreeFold Token?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, tokens are generated when ThreeFold Farmers adds capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the ThreeFold Token is the medium of exchange on the new internet. So, if a developer wants to build something (e.g. a website or an app) or a user wants to store something (e.g. photos), he&#x2F;she&#x2F;they use(s) ThreeFold Tokens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The current growth of internet needs 4000+ new large scale data centers of computer systems. The global data growth will reach more than 40 Zetabytes by 2020 which represents an average yearly growth of 42% starting at 4.5 Zetabytes in 2013. To host all this data, over 4000 new big data centers have to to be built. And to achieve this goal, $ 1 trillion USD investment capital is needed and land totalling the size of the UK would be needed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The Internet is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. In this article we&#x27;ll explain why that&#x27;s not always such a good thing and where we see opportunities.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Internet capacity needs to become localized&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big majority of users in the world connect to servers that are not present in their region and as such experience higher costs and low performance. According to a study by datacentermap.com, 80% of the data centers of the current Internet‚Äôs service providers are based in the U.S. and Europe. The rest of the world has scarce Internet resources dotted around territories.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As a consequence most Internet users use Internet-based services running on infrastructure which is located far away from their physical location and most likely outside their country‚Äôs borders. This decreases the general end-user experience (latency) but also adds unnecessary costs to transporting the information back and forth. Also, it adds legislation and compliance headaches to enterprises.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our mission is to empower and inspire people to recognize abundance by living new experiences one hour at a time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-perform-better&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-perform-better&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-perform-better&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to perform better&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute and Storage vendors create poor-performing solutions. There have been yearly improvements in hardware following Moore‚Äôs law. While this has allowed ThreeFold to progress and innovate, it has also led to software developers taking these advances for granted; cutting corners where they can, creating sub-optimal code and allowing software components to be layered on top of each other to achieve certain behavioral functionalities.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The inefficiencies have now led to a situation where organically-grown IT architectures are immensely complex. They use a variety of components from different software and hardware vendors integrated by so called ‚Äòintegrators‚Äô. The overall effort and cost involved to create, operate and maintain such architectures is growing continuously and requiring an ever-increasing budget and resourcing to continue.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
If we could go down to the core algorithms and take another look at these, and innovate at the heart of technology instead of applying patches and pain killers, we would be able to create much more end-user capacity than what systems provide today. Systems will last longer and will not have to be replaced by faster ones. Also, fewer engineers will be needed to create, operate and maintain these systems. Combined, these elements would present a more stable and reliable platform that can achieve higher levels of uptime.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Only upsides, right? Well a huge downside of such an approach is that vendors will make less revenue and more importantly less margin as systems will run for longer, be more stable and require less updates. So why would vendors innovate at the core of their solution?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the current Internet is responsible for between 5 and 10% of global energy consumptions? Making it more harmful to our planet than the airline Industry. The good news is that we can achieve 10x more power efficiency by addressing certain areas such as storage.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold believes IT can do a much better job at being more sustainable - in fact ThreeFold believes it can reduce the Internet‚Äôs carbon footprint by 10 times compared to other industry standards in IT capacity producing solutions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance that in theory would require more racks and cooling. ThreeFold‚Äôs architectural approach brought solutions that enables it‚Äôs Farmers to achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses fewer racks) and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to become more affordable&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost in running IT architectures is the human cost. Today‚Äôs complex systems, built out of ‚Äòband aid and patches‚Äô point solutions, organically-grown and badly documented IT infrastructures, need an armada of people to keep them ticking. Even though this is an example, one can learn a lot from the trends that are presented:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of Full-time equivalent in the company, of which 85% are insourced and 15% on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn‚Äôt retain internal know-how to operate their IT.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 50% of IT budgets are spent on Infrastructure ane operations. Similarly, a big part goes to applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the IT department.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 65% of the IT budget is spent on resources and services, around 35% is spent on hardware and software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
These figures present industry average numbers and paint a troubling picture that IT is a sizeable part of an overall budget, and that most spending is going to have the right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture it relies on. For any other discipline in any organisation this would present an unacceptable risk to the business and its continuity - strangely not for IT.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to become self-healing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest source of downtime in computer systems is people. Getting people involved in fixing infrastructure problems creates the risk of accidentally causing more system downtime. A very recent example on this hit a large organisation cloud service provider.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
20+ years ago when Internet data centers came into existence next to telecom points of presence (POP), the level of complication in architecting, and building and maintaining these infrastructures exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of data around the globe, these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to, processed, and the obtained results sent back to end users on the other side of the globe.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Managing a data center that contains solutions for information transportation, storage and processing is not an easy task and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented in regards to the processing and storing of information has also exploded. This resulted in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build, operate and maintain these IT systems.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The time has come that we no longer rely on people to do the right thing in case of emergency - the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on the availability of that information is huge. Having people to do manual deployments and operational responsibilities does not provide the agility and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to take the human element out of IT and let smart and autonomous systems to take over. This will also let people focus on more creative activities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The world needs a responsible internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a humanitarian level the opportunities for creativity, learning and development are currently negatively influenced by a lack of access to performant and affordable Internet services. Since &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7#:%7E:text=Due%20to%20the%20lack%20of,20.&quot;&gt;Internet access is a human right&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it should protect the status quo between the developed and less-developed regions of our world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet is growing fast, with the wrong solutions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the current solutions are super unsustainable and make no sense. Luckily, ThreeFold and many other start-ups are deploying new solutions.

&lt;p&gt;Have you seen ‚ÄòThe Great Hack‚Äô on Netflix? It‚Äôs a documentary about the Cambridge Analytica hacking scandal, where personal data of millions of peoples‚Äô Facebook profiles were harvested without their consent and used for political advertising purposes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While watching it, I couldn‚Äôt help but think how unfair it is that in today‚Äôs digital society, people are being treated like products, because there is no such thing as a ‚Äòfree‚Äô platform without YOU being the product. What did reassure me, is that people are sick of having their data used this way. But what they might not know, is that the internet problem is bigger than ‚Äòjust‚Äô data protection.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The Internet is growing at an exponential rate. To service this demand, a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today. However, the Internet is expanding much faster than datacenters and the planet can cope with. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition to that, the Internet is extremely centralized, with most of these data centers being located in the US. Think of it like electricity. If consumers in, for example, Turkey had to use electricity generated in the US, it would be too expensive and inefficient, because it is too far away. The transmission lines would be too strained and losses and repairs would make it unsustainable. Capacity is like electricity. When centralized, it becomes too expensive and wasteful for remote users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is the solution to these problems?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet needs to be more distributed, cost-effective, neutral, and sustainable. ThreeFold has developed such a new technology, the ThreeFold Grid (Grid) and a token which enables all this to happen.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Combining the values of the ThreeFold Foundation (freedom, equality and fairness) with the technology developed by TFTech (Zero-OS, Zero-Chain, 3Bot) and a digital currency called the ThreeFold Token (a decentralized digital currency and means of payment to exchange autonomous and decentralized Internet services)  we believe that we have all the tools in order to actually make a difference in tomorrow‚Äôs digital world. Question is, are you ready to join us?

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the Internet changed the world as we know it with the introduction of the World Wide Web. With time the Internet empowered people to share information in a decentralized way. Shortly after, big companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple emerged, providing many solutions that revolutionized the way we live. The ‚Äúsharing economy‚Äù has grown exponentially over the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to a more simplified information flow and well-developed technology, which:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of marketplace operators.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We are entering a flat-structure economy. An economy where fewer managerial levels are needed for the system to function. New technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things facilitate this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis, forming marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-current-internet-is-centralized&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-current-internet-is-centralized&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-current-internet-is-centralized&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The current Internet is centralized&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growth in popularity for decentralized systems, organizations, and currencies, the Internet remains centralized. The centralization within the Internet industry brought many barriers to entry. Indeed, to compete in the highly competitive market of Internet capacity dominated by big IT companies, massive investment, and IT development are needed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
But what is really scary is that the current industry exploits the market tremendously. Data is officially the most valuable asset on earth for a few years, and about 20 companies rule over more than 80% of the cloud industry. In other words - these companies together have more than 80% of the world‚Äôs information. In recent years, we noticed the dangers that can arise with the wrong intentions within the data industry with the ‚ÄòCambridge Analytica Scandal‚Äô, also highlighted in the movie &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo&quot;&gt;‚ÄòThe Great Hack‚Äô.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold has been developing technology that allows the decentralization of the Internet infrastructure - removing the need for data centers, and allowing anyone to take part in the Internet capacity market. Adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) makes you a ThreeFold Farmer (TF Farmer). The more decentralized the Internet gets, the more secure and effective it will become. The already is the largest grid of compute and storage in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-participate&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-to-participate&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-to-participate&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How To Participate&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of becoming a ThreeFold Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the ThreeFold Grid by downloading the ThreeFold Zero-OS onto their nodes and connecting them to the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By doing this you will become an operator of a ‚Äúmicro data center‚Äù and with that earn ThreeFold Tokens. With or without experience in the field, anyone can become a ThreeFold Farmer. By becoming a ThreeFold Farmer, you empower a new neutral Internet that belongs to humanity - not corporations.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
You can build your server (3node) and configure it, but also options for people with less technical knowledge are available. Please see &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pre-register.threefold.io&quot;&gt;pre-register.threefold.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to see how easy it is for anyone to become a ThreeFold Farmer.

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-little-history-on-blockchain-technology&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-little-history-on-blockchain-technology&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-little-history-on-blockchain-technology&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A little history on blockchain technology&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone thinks that Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain technology when he published his whitepaper in January 2009 to make a digital currency the first use case. But it was not!.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In 1991, Dr. W. Scott Stornetta published a white paper in which he introduced a ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô as a decentralized database where digital transactions are secured. The research focused on creating a digital hierarchy system that time-stamped and chronologically secured deals in a chain of blocks.  The first considered use case for blockchain technology was to sign and store land deeds digitally. The technology‚Äôs main characteristics were decentralization and immutability across the process of storing transaction data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Satoshi was the person (or part of a group of people) that used these blockchain principles to create the first digital currency - Bitcoin.  The rest is history, from one to many digital currencies based on different creation principles (also referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital coins, etc.) that have been launched and existed for over a decade and have begun to come more into the mainstream purview.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization-and-immutability&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization-and-immutability&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization-and-immutability&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization and immutability&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two characteristics that have spawned interest in Blockchain technology are decentralization and immutability. In the current world, centralization is everywhere, in most industries, governments, education systems, the world wide web (Internet), and more. All roads these days seem to lead to centralized setups.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Examples of centralized setups today:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monetary&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Fiat currencies are governed and controlled by central banks.  According to Wikipedia: ‚ÄúA central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state‚Äôs currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank has a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state and prints the national currency, which serves as the state‚Äôs legal tender. Central banks also act as a ‚Äúlender of last resort‚Äù to the banking sector during a financial crisis. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the solvency of member institutions, prevent bank runs, and prevent reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.‚Äú So central banks control fiat currencies, and other institutions control central banks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Wide Web (WWW)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The World Wide Web is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Although distributed by design, this technology shares and exposes globally developed information and centralized functions crucial to make this World Wide Web work: large (commercial) monopolies have developed centralized search facilities, e.g., yellow pages of the world wide web. These search facilities now control what you find when you are looking for a specific search term.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
There seems to be a natural ‚Äúdesire‚Äù to organize and create different things with central control. Probably the result of our (humankind) social models based on hierarchies and competition. These social models have influenced a lot of what we have built in the industrial and information revolution - creating centralization as the defacto standard of building anything.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Now that we have invented a technology that potentially can build different things without a lot of centralization, we need to be careful to use it for the right things.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-myths&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-myths&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-myths&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain myths&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate what potential right use cases exist for blockchain technologies, let spend some time on some of the blockchain myths created in recent years. Similar to other new technologies, blockchains market themselves as a miracle technology that overcomes many (if not any) of the challenges and difficulties that exist in modern-day digital technology. Let‚Äôs name and investigate a few.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains are ‚ÄúSuper Scalable‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they? Pure blockchain deployments are not super scalable compared to conventional (server-based) transaction methods.  Current financial blockchain transaction times are very slow compared to any other (currency) transaction technologies out there, being it card transactions like Mastercard, VISA, or money transfers from one bank account to another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain technology brings ‚ÄúImpeccable security.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very questionable! While blockchains use cryptographic standards, the methods to ensure privacy is entirely outside of any blockchain standards and implementations. It‚Äôs every implementer‚Äôs responsibility to ensure security, therefore mostly handled as it is in the old (conventional?) world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;When using Blockchains, ‚ÄúTrustworthiness is guaranteed.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By what? Blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and information storage, but otherwise, nothing is inherently trustworthy about any fact stored on the Blockchain. You need to corroborate trustworthiness by ensuring that the parties who store information in the Blockchain are incorruptible and that these facts are correct ‚Äîjust as you would in the rest of the world without using blockchain technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains can manage ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a protocol expressed in code, and this does not define in terms of any standard. There are no standards bodies to provide sanctioned implementation rules or guidance.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Many contracts or types of data are better dealt with not on a blockchain: as it is a database that has only write and read functionality, but no update nor deletion is possible, it‚Äôs even dangerous to post sensitive and personal data on a blockchain, and if not used well, there might raise conflicts with regulations such as GDPR. However, a blockchain can provide consensus where required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Smart contracts on the Blockchain can do ‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially but maybe not in the way how people see it today. While this is technically true, Blockchain is limited to well-understood and straightforward use cases, without ambiguities. Smart contracts are essentially rocket science. By design, once published (launched), you cannot revise or bug fix them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not the same thing! Private blockchains are not the answer to privacy or restricted access to information. Purely private&#x2F;enterprise blockchains might fail to realize any of the benefits of Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A new feature, ‚Äújustifies deploying a new Blockchain.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community-driven blockchain products are being forked left and right by private players who enhance them in various ways. But only the open-source blockchains with the largest communities and install-plus-adoption bases will persist. The rest are mainly lab experiments, and 99.9 percent of these probably fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Blockchain is a hyped new technology, but they are not the answer to everything.  Just like with any other technology or tool, you need to consider if the use case considered carefully is appropriate. In the end, it is only neutral characteristics that might be a reason for applying a blockchain or not:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a need for decentralization?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a need for immutability?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
When considering Blockchain technology for a specific purpose, proper due diligence should happen. This to determine the fit and implementing it if it enhances value for the organization. Humans play a vital role in the decision process and are required to find solutions for the flaws that blockchains bring along.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Scalability, security, trustworthiness, functionality are to be added by humans to blockchain deployments.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This delicate mix of characteristics to be implemented explains why many Blockchain projects don‚Äôt succeed, despite the rightful claims around the disruptive nature of the technology.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Two frequent mistakes within the Industry:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technology is used as the ultimate technology to solve all the problems described above, and this often leads to failure in the end as Blockchain can‚Äôt fulfill these promises.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technology is used under the false pretext that decentralization is wanted, whereas the real intention is to be in control. Blockchain thinking also requires an entirely different way of thinking than the classical models embedded in the heart of our economies: concentration of power &amp;amp; control and competition need to make room for decentralization and collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains are here to stay!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the hype around blockchain technology and also all the failed initiatives, blockchain technology does allow for digital worlds to exist without centralization.  The information revolution has brought forward a lot of progress and innovation to the people; however, the outcome has also been only a few large organizations controlling all of it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Examples are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online search: Google&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online social: Facebook, Twitter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online banking: any large international bank&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online insurance:  few insurance alliances&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Relationship Management: SalesForce&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Resource Management: Oracle, SAP
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All these organizations are leading in their specific digital innovation sector, and some of them even provide services for free.  Nothing is for free in this world and reality -in return for these services, you accept the terms and conditions which allow the companies to use your personal information and user statistics for their benefits and make money from this behavior derived data. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Most industry leaders have become so powerful that there is almost no way around them anymore. You are practically obliged to comply with their terms and conditions to do something useful with the Internet today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
The world is awakening and seeking alternatives in which such monopolistic structures do not control data and information.  Blockchain technologies allow new solutions to be built without central governing bodies, creating person-to-person sharing and trading opportunities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The combination of people and blockchains is really powerful&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People remain the best to create decentralized business models that combine Blockchain‚Äôs strengths with complementary measures to compensate for the weaknesses of the technology. Blockchains are not replacing people. Blockchain technology is just a tool that enhances people‚Äôs ability to organize themselves around decentralized initiatives that require no central body to govern and control. Therefore, Blockchain is a powerful tool indeed but remains just a tool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A platform for people to start blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there would be a platform where the strong points of blockchains (decentralization) could enable people to organize themselves around a random initiative and launch it based on blockchain technology?  Blockchain As a Service (BAAS).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A platform like that could be powerful to enable people around the world to use and benefit from blockchain technology to organize themselves around digital initiatives, currencies, finance, trade, company, anything. Let‚Äôs consider a small example:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
e.g., Sixty people want to start an organization in which they all have an equal stake.  They can organize this by going to the notary and establishing a company with equity and dividing the equity amongst them. They can run quarterly &#x2F;annual meetings to govern and control the company. They would also need an administration to record decisions and communicate across the organization.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
What if a platform could launch several blockchain nodes (60, one for each of them) and record all decisions, having all information trackable and traceable for anyone? Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) will enable people to organize themselves independently and create new movements, companies, groups, tribes. This would be a powerful platform allowing many people (and hopefully all people) to organize themselves in new ways, free of the need to have notaries, lawyers, and contracts.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
However, to build such a platform, compliance is needed with some pretty specific requirements.  Requirements that enable such a platform not to be governed and controlled by a single organization.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The requirements for such a platform would sum up as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single organization cannot own the platform, it needs to be owned by many&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such a platform cannot have administrator access.  Administrators access takes away the neutrality and privacy that such a platform requires.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be very efficient.  To be available to all people globally, it needs to be affordable for anyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be everywhere.  Part of the efficiency is that it should require expensive international access lines - it needs to be able to live everywhere - in well connected (and affordable) areas as well as in less well-connected places.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Such a platform is a very different platform than most of what we know today.  It needs to be a platform build by many people, for anyone.  It needs not be governed by a single organization; it needs to be governed by many.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
People with the right intentions need to collectively build a platform based on hardware owned by many and software that is open and can be inspected and improved by anyone. It is a platform created by people for people using blockchain technology to achieve a genuinely decentralized nature of the platform running Blockchain as a service.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
People should always remain as the element that brings trust in IT. Blockchains help to register that trust forever.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dubai, UAE. Today at GITEX Technology Week, ThreeFold signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to cooperate in the CEEMA region on the implementation of a decentralized grid of computing and storage capacity, which enables a neutral, low cost and low energy internet on a global scale.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
HPE provides their clients in the CEEMA region with the option to connect their computing and storage capacity to ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized grid that supports ThreeFold‚Äôs mission to provide a Responsible Internet, accessible to all.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
HPE server and storage hardware has been certified to be used on ThreeFold‚Äôs Grid and HPE plans to build services to support the growth and usage of ThreeFold‚Äôs Grid which is in line with their edge cloud and blockchain strategy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold launched a Responsible Internet capacity platform (on March 2018) with the support and collaboration from its community, and has already achieved sizable deployments of decentralized internet compute and storage capacity across the globe. ThreeFold‚Äôs open source and localized IT capacity encourage developers; as a result of cost and performance efficiencies, to build all types of decentralized applications on its network to promote the expansion of a new digital responsible economy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúThis is a monumental step towards a new responsible internet and empowering a new digital economy‚Äú, Kristof De Spiegeleer, Visionary Co-Founder of ThreeFold.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThreeFold has created one of the smartest Blockchain solutions we have come across‚Äù, said Johannes Koch: Vice President and HPE CEEMA Managing Director. ‚ÄúWe are excited about our future cooperation‚Äù.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold nodes natively run containers - therefore they can run any Docker service.  But it does so in a more efficient way than the current Docker engine - the most used and known container technology platform in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;iaas&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#iaas&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: iaas&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;IAAS&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold node technology enables hardware capabilities to be used for IAAS services in a very efficient way.  Overhead is reduced to a minimum by stripping out unnecessary layers of software that have been implemented over the last decade to patch scaling and performance problems. Our engineers have always looked at the root cause of issues and by innovating at the core algorithm level, solved many issues.
Examples are:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less is more&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Scale down the operating system for a virtualization architecture to a minimum and boot it over the network - no local operating system files installed on local storage.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at root causes, no painkiller approach&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Step away from existing storage solutions that require proprietary acceleration hardware and use standard off the shelf, affordable and efficient components with a 100% software-based storage solution that can withstand hardware failures without requiring human intervention - creating a very efficient, reliable and performing storage solution that can operate standalone.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The platform is secured by using a network boot mechanism that makes it virtually hack resistant as there are no operating system files installed locally. Infrastructure as a service traditionally runs in hyper-scale data centers, remote from the businesses using it. ThreeFold node technology allows you to install, operate and run IAAS services close to your business locations operated by your local IT team.  It operates on a peer-to-peer network - only transferring bits of data that need to be transported to avoid network congestion and traffic bottlenecks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;archive&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#archive&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: archive&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Archive&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data generation is growing exponentially. More data has been generated in the last 2 years than ever before. This creates a big need to archive data. The ThreeFold node technology creates storage and archiving capabilities by using standard hardware and known interfaces (S3, FTP, WebDav, CIFS, and NFS) will be built by developers worldwide and made available.  The low-level storage functionality supports version controlling of the archived data, which keeps all relevant changes without any limitation by using a small amount of actual storage capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data security and reliability are key aspects of any storage system.  The ThreeFold node allows all data to be compressed and encrypted if and when needed. The distributed character of the storage system enables site redundant storage algorithms to be deployed while keeping large data volumes from being stored in a single location. This removes the risk of data being stolen (physically) and prevents a site outage to result in data outage.  The distributed character of the system is in line with the increasing spread of actual data generation.  ThreeFold has sensory equipment everywhere these days, and the overhead of storing all that information in a few central places is enormous. Data collection and storage happens once - reading data to use it for a particular workload happens many times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-mining&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#data-mining&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: data-mining&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Data Mining&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On traditional server architectures, every application has to set up its servers that run their code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard. The distributed character of the ThreeFold node technology presents compute and storage capacity everywhere.  This enables large data mining workloads to happen close to the source of the data.  By storing data in a distributed manner, mining can be distributed as well. Distributed compute capacity next to storage capabilities creates the possibility to create data mining operations on local storage (which makes it very fast and efficient) by coding data mining algorithms in programming languages (such as Python, Lua, Javascript, and Golang). Data mining follows distributed data storage.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Never run into scalability problems again with the ThreeFold node. Data storage can expand horizontally using thousands of distributed nodes to create large storage volumes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;smart-contracts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#smart-contracts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: smart-contracts&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart contracts are applications that run on a decentralized platform, exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. These applications run on a blockchain, a powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of that value. Smart contracts enable developers to create markets, store registries of debts (or promises), move funds following past instructions (like a will or a futures contract), and many other things without a middleman or counterparty risk.  ThreeFold nodes run based on smart-contracts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;self-learning-and-ai&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#self-learning-and-ai&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: self-learning-and-ai&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Self-Learning and AI&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchains can be seen as databases. By current database standards, traditional blockchains like Bitcoin are terrible: low throughout, low capacity, high latency, poor query support, and so on. But even with these terrible characteristics, blockchains introduced three new and important characteristics:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized data and shared data control&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;  leads to more data and better qualitative data which results in better models. Shortening the machine learning time also enables AI to progress at a faster pace.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immutable audit trails&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; improve the trustworthiness of the data, and improves the models‚Äô provenance on training and testing results.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native assets&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and assets exchanges make training and testing models intellectual property (IP) assets easier - enhancing decentralized data and model exchanges.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Blockchain technology allows more and better quality data to be presented to machine learning algorithms.  It has been proven (Microsoft researchers - Banko and Brill) that more data ‚Äî not just a bit more data but way more data ‚Äî while using the same algorithms results in a lot better machine learning.  Meaning that the future of machine learning is not in trying to create more sophisticated algorithms (which will happen). So by moving AI learning into a blockchain environment we speed up machine learning and in the end create AI.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term Edge Cloud or, to be more precise, Edge Computing is one of the most exciting technology terms of these days. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;421&quot; src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;embed&#x2F;7uA9aoIfMZo&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;aautoplay; encrypted-media;&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;&#x2F;iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;edge-computing-definition&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#edge-computing-definition&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: edge-computing-definition&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Edge Computing Definition&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;Edge computing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is a distributed computing paradigm in which computation is largely or entirely performed on distributed device nodes known as smart devices or edge devices as opposed to primarily taking place in a centralized cloud environment. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In summary, this means that the cloud is divided into smaller pieces and distributed to the edge of the network. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;drivers-for-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#drivers-for-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: drivers-for-edge-computing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Drivers for Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some latency-sensitive applications require fast response times to work correctly. A good example is self-driving cars. A lot of decisions in autonomous vehicles have to be made instantaneously; the decision to react to the unexpected while driving at high speed cannot afford to be slowed down by data traveling long distances to be processed. To improve the system‚Äôs reliability, additional hops, and any further points of failure must be eliminated. Moving to compute as far out as possible to the Edge is the logical choice.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
More generically, real-world situations are increasingly relying on an IT component to be involved in some form of decision making where time is of the essence.  The current IT setup is that we have highly concentrated IT setups in data centers connected by fast networks to the rest of the world. This setup is rapidly becoming obsolete as we need to have the fastest possible response for everyday activities, which cannot sustain the time delay caused by (extended) network connections.  Having actual data processing and storage facilities close to these real-world situations is the next IT capacity evolution.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
These thousands of situations are mostly in the IoT area. Still, other killer applications like streaming would greatly benefit from being served from the Edge rather than a distant central location.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;edge-computing-market-facts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#edge-computing-market-facts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: edge-computing-market-facts&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Edge Computing Market Facts&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the billions of IoT devices driven by various use cases like autonomous driving,  a massive demand for Edge Computing is evolving rapidly. According to the Digital Journal, the Edge Computing market is growing extremely fast. With a  CAGR of over 35.0% and the market is expected to reach  USD 33.75 billion by the end of 2023.

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Edge Computing and Grid Computing are often used in the same context and sometimes are confused. For this article, we‚Äôd like to define the terms going forward as follows: 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Grid Computing means a computer network of 100% distributed computer resources like processing power, memory, and data storage of similar or different types to which authorized people can run their computation workloads. That means that Grid Compute nodes are mostly in data centers and maybe dispersed over more extensive regions but are typically still far from the Edge. Compared to Edge Computing,  Grid Computing environments are owned by more than one individual or company, and thus, controlled by many.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Edge computing has risen from a need to have data processing and storage as close as possible to real-world situations.  The situation could be as simple as recording biometric data by a smartwatch to support the required information for a self-driving car to function as intended.  The necessity comes from having local computing and storage capacity - it can be used by multiple use cases (situations) but does not have to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits-of-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-benefits-of-edge-computing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Benefits of Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edge computing comes with specific benefits that are mandatory for the next evolution in the IT industry.  We have optimized the central model to such a degree that the network connects the central capacity to use cases in the field, the next bottleneck.  Edge computing is solving several challenges faced by real-world situations with the following benefits:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;speed&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#speed&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: speed&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Speed&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is probably the most crucial benefit of edge computing, as there are plenty of use cases that require near-real-time computing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;scalability&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#scalability&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: scalability&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Scalability&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scalability of edge computing also makes it incredibly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vxchnge.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;edge-computing-use-cases&quot;&gt;versatile&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. By partnering with local data centers further out on the Edge, companies can easily target desirable markets without investing in expensive infrastructure expansion. Edge data centers allow them to service end-users efficiently with little physical distance or latency. They also do not constrain companies with a substantial footprint, allowing them to shift to other markets rapidly should economic conditions change.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;availability-and-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#availability-and-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: availability-and-security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Availability and Security&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional cloud computing architecture is, by definition, centralized, which makes it especially vulnerable to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vxchnge.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-protect-data-centers-from-a-new-generation-of-ddos-attacks&quot;&gt;distributed denial of service (DDoS)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; attacks and power outages. Edge computing distributes processing, storage, and applications across a wide range of devices, nodes and data centers, which makes it difficult for any single disruption to take down the network which is why logically and geographically dispersed systems are often used for DDoS mitigation like in Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By pushing everything to the cloud, you‚Äôre leaving your business open to ISP failures and cloud server downtime. Many mission-critical operations like railroads and chemical plants won‚Äôt even use the cloud today. Their server farms are the only way to guarantee uptime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;process-optimisation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#process-optimisation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: process-optimisation&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Process optimisation&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big benefit is process optimization. If self-driving cars were to use the cloud instead of the Edge, they‚Äôd be pushing all the data they gather up to the cloud. But if the Edge makes local decisions, the cloud may not need all that data immediately ‚Äì or even at all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements-for-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#requirements-for-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: requirements-for-edge-computing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Requirements for Edge Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When compute and storage capabilities exist on the Edge, we need to overcome several challenges around capacity distribution.  Most traditional IT technologies do not allow this as they live in large data centers where there is a lot of ‚Äúcare‚Äù for these technologies.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The most significant generic hurdle to overcome is that there is going to be a lot less ‚Äúcare‚Äù for the technology to rely on at the Edge.  These ‚Äúdevices‚Äù have to be self-sufficient to no small degree.  If we want to sum up some of the specifics of edge technology, this will come out:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A typical edge device or node must run an OS that comes in at a low cost or, ideally, for free like some open source offerings. This enhances the proliferation of capacity at the Edge. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container technology must be embedded in the OS at the lowest possible level to create the maximum benefit of efficiency from the edge hardware: classic Virtual Machine environments are just too inefficient and resource consuming for edge use cases. There will be Virtual Machine based edge solutions, but these are going to be out there for a certain period, catering for current IT workloads to move to the Edge.  The Edge‚Äôs correct move can only happen when traditional IT applications split up into pieces and require a lot less capacity to run.  Hence, it will convert over time to containerized technology.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge Computing hardware will consist of datacenter grade hardware and all sorts of other types of hardware.  The Edge might include some smaller sized data center facilities but also include different types of ‚Äúhomes‚Äù for compute and storage equipment.  Think of transportation as a specific use case - capacity on maritime vessels, capacity on trains, and vehicles‚Äô capacity.  Hardware will have to accommodate different use cases,  price levels, form factors, and power consumption. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edge hardware needs a lightweight OS that is very close to the hardware components to get the maximum out of compute and storage capacity.  Less is more - for real Edge capacity, local people won‚Äôt be able to interact with edge capacity - one further step - there will be no need to have remote people access these devices for maintenance purposes.  The ultimate edge computing solution will have a significant amount of self-sustainability - where there are no more highly technically skilled people required to keep the capacity available, up and running.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In most cases, Edge means being remote, and having no access to humans or humans are only too expensive for the specific use case. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power outages or no network availability will cause system failures. The ideal OS to deal with this revolves around no people; the zero-touch approach should be stateless and needs to have self-healing capabilities run by automation software robots.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;existing-edge-computing-solutions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#existing-edge-computing-solutions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: existing-edge-computing-solutions&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Existing Edge Computing Solutions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today there are a few Edge Computing platforms out there that cover some requirements as outlined above. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft, for instance, launched products like Azure IoT Edge and Azure Data Box Edge to extend their Datacenter based Azure cloud offering to the Edge. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another attempt to bring centralized cloud technology to the Edge is the Openstack Edge Computing initiative, which is in the concept phase only so far. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new OS for the Edge is CoreOs, also known as Container Linux, which runs on nearly any platform, whether physical, virtual, or private&#x2F;public cloud.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More recently, there are a few blockchain-driven technologies out there pushing for edge capacity to exist.  Examples are:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sia.tech&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SIA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sonm.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Sonm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content delivery networks with a lot of ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù sitting close to end-users are expanding their capabilities beyond content delivery
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.limelight.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;iot-and-edge-cloud&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Limelight&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.akamai.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akamai&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-holy-grail&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-holy-grail&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-holy-grail&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Holy Grail&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The holy grail would be a self-healing Edge Grid. Edge, because of all the benefits Edge Computing brings to the user: Speed, Scalability, Reliability, Security, Versatility, and Process Optimization. Grid, because it fulfills the distributed workload requirements, a classic centralized cloud would generally be used without a centralized nature and all its disadvantages.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Probably the most critical part of the ideal solution is self-healing. The biggest challenge of an Edge Computing environment is the dependency on local care: humans to maintain hardware and upgrade or fix software components. Self Healing needs to do the job here, which means zero people can be involved. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Only a self-healing mechanism with zero-people involved, completely decentralized, brings down the cost and provides more security to the environment, and makes it highly scalable. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Some of you may think that new blockchain-based technologies may be the holy grail. But they are not.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In most cases, their implementations are too slow, and that‚Äôs why it does not make sense to use them for production purposes. Another downside is the complexity of the application caused by stitching together 3rd party technologies. In many cases, these blockchain-based technologies are at a very early stage with beta implementations or even roadmap only type of technology.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The holy grail is something that hasn‚Äôt been created before; it needs to be a versatile system that is self-manageable.  A large global conglomerate should not own the capacity - it should be owned by many. Therefore, it should have a commercial model where people individually can decide to partake in building this global edge solution and where there is a defined return on investment for those partakers.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A few groups of people, like us, are creating decentralized solutions for this, owned by the many, and creating services for all. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs technology does not follow the traditional IT model&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edge internet needs a different approach. So, we started from scratch and shaped a new approach. ThreeFold‚Äôs open-source technology addresses the scalability, security, storage, energy, and operating issues by simplifying architectures and not relying on third-party software. This drives down costs and improves efficiencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is ThreeFold‚Äôs Technology Toolbox?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs technology is based on three primary building blocks:  Stateless Computing, Self-Healing Technology, and Blockchain technology - this is the core of our ‚ÄúTechnology Toolbox‚Äú.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stateless Computing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Edge Internet grid generating IT storage and compute capacity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Healing Technology&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: controls and operates a distributed cloud and reserves, procures, and executes workloads on the grid using our Jumpscale platform. It delivers autoscaling and automation frameworks that enable self-healing and can be adapted for any kind of IT workload.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain Technology&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Via Rivine - our secure, scalable ‚Äúproof of stake‚Äù blockchain, along with our identity management platform, ItsYou.online. Our blockchain technology enables user authentication, access controls, secure workloads, and heightened security.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabling-stateless-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#enabling-stateless-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: enabling-stateless-computing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Enabling Stateless Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global decentralized internet will be composed of thousands (millions?) of nodes distributed geographically.  This means the decentralized internet must be powered by a stateless operating system that can be booted via the Internet (as opposed to living on the node locally). This removes the complexity of upgrades, truck rolls, etc. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Open-source components have been developed, Zero-OS, for the deployment of bare metal machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.  Our Zero-OS platform runs containerized applications and software code on secure and distributed IT infrastructure.  Zero-OS can be deployed on off-the-shelf hardware by anyone willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within our network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The benefits of Stateless Computing are substantial, including:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: lightweight OS without overhead for running bare-metal machines.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: finds the optimal performance of server &amp;amp; storage nodes at no cost.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: no data footprint remains while workloads move from one node to another.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: capacity is generated without the need for data centers: At The Edge.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-available&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Technology that is self-healing &amp;amp; self-driving&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs Jumpscale framework and ZeroBot allow the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment. The bots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure, and runtime environments, to guarantee the performance and availability of applications at all times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The benefits of our self-healing technology protocols include the following:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Healing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the platform regenerates when health issues that cause downtime for infrastructure and applications are detected. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: agents capture information from the grid and make intelligent decisions to provide an ideal and optimal host environment for software code and containerized applications.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifecycle Management&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the status of the infrastructure and the lifecycle of running applications are constantly checked and recorded.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autoscaling&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain Technology to execute workloads and applications via smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers developed new blockchain algorithms based on proof of stake for validation purposes and turned this into our Rivine open-source blockchain software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Unlike the ‚Äúproof of work‚Äù blockchains that currently dominate the space, our Rivine blockchain is scalable, green, and secure - and does not rely on huge mining resources.  We run our blockchain on approximately 200 dedicated nodes and do not rely on any third-party software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition to our blockchain technology, we have also developed ItsYou.Online, an identity, and access management platform.  Itsyou. online uses three-factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: our algorithms to reach consensus use a minimal amount of energy and electricity compared to other blockchain software and networks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowest possible cost&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: of transactions make it an efficient and fast payment system.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: state of the network and applications are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment fulfillment&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: transactions are automatically paid using ThreeFold Tokens.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: fully automated execution of contracts from customers buying Internet IT capacity.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All of our technology is open-source and can be accessed in the following Github Repos:

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has the power to change the world of IT. There are a huge number of new initiatives using blockchain technology around the world, with countless use cases.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In general, there are two types of blockchains: proof of work blockchains and proof of stake blockchains. They are consensus algorithms on how transactions are verified and added to the ledger (forever, as blockchains provide an immutable record of events). More on these two types of blockchains below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-basics&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-basics&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-basics&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain Basics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is, as the word says, a chain of blocks of information. These ‚Äúblocks‚Äù contain information on transactions. For instance transactions like the transfer of value of a digital currency (token) from wallet A to wallet B. The ‚Äúchain‚Äù aspect comes when part of the information is stored in a block as a link to the previous block (a unique number). This is a very simple representation of what a blockchain is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Private, Permissioned or Public Blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity around a blockchain comes from how the blockchain software is run. The software can run in two different ways: a small (or large) number of nodes controlled by one single entity (private blockchain) a person or a company, or a large (or small) number of nodes controlled by multiple entities (public) that do not know each other and where anyone interested to run a blockchain node can join.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By running blockchain software under the supervision of one entity (private, centralized) you can quite easily make sure the information stored in the blockchain (transactions) are not tempered with by only operating a small number of nodes and deploying them in very safe physical locations (private data-centers, vaults, basements of offices, etc). A private blockchain does not allow unknown entities to join and run the blockchain software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A permissioned blockchain is operated by known entities such as stakeholders of a given industry. It is a mix of both private and public blockchains. In this type of blockchain network, a participant may not need permission to join the network but needs permission to transact with another network participant.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A public blockchain allows anyone to join the blockchain operation and create a new blockchain node. The blockchain is run by multiple entities (decentralized, public) that have no relationship nor knowledge about each other 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
For these three types of blockchains, there are different mechanisms to protect and guarantee the validity of transactions and make them tamper-proof.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Private Data and Anonymous or Pseudo-Anonymous Data?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For private blockchains, it is straightforward to see that all data that is stored on private blockchains is private and creates 100% anonymity for its users. The only entity or person that has access to information stored on the blockchain is the blockchain operator. This is comparable to how a bank operates. The bank knows everything about all of its customers and the customers only know about themselves - the non-bank customers do not know a thing.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
On a public blockchain, people can join and operate a blockchain node on which all information of that blockchain is stored. While private blockchains get their security from putting their blockchain nodes in secure buildings operated by trusted people a public blockchain achieves its security from having a large number of nodes that have the same data replicated over and over. A consensus algorithm is required in order to accept new data (new blocks) to the chain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Consensus Protocols for Public Blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main consensus protocols used today are Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Proof of Work (High Cost in Compute and Energy)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof of work consensus protocol is best explained as a race. The consensus is achieved by having all participating nodes solve a puzzle. The puzzle is a one-way translation of an amount of information consisting of the following items:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the data that present the transactions in the block - all the data is known by all participating nodes&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of the previous block. Remember a blockchain links blocks of information together.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A (variable) number. This number is the part that can be changed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ‚Äúwork‚Äù is done by changing the variable number and see what the translation of all data brings. The translation of all this data is a new number, and the requirement is that that number needs to be smaller than what is known as the ‚Äúdifficulty level‚Äù. The difficulty level number has a fixed amount of numbers but when the first digits of the number are zero the overall number is lower. So a higher difficulty is built by having a number that has more zeros at the start in the difficulty number.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Once the block is completed, all nodes will get the complete block of transactional data, everyone knows the previous block number and will start to change the variable number to get output from the puzzle algorithms comparing it to the required difficulty level.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The node that will find the number first will announce that it has found a solution matching the required difficulty level and the variable number of shared with all nodes in the network to verify that his solution is correct. If a large portion of the nodes has verified the solution to be valid the solution is accepted and the block is added to the chain because consensus is reached.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Proof of (Block) Stake (Low Cost in Compute and Energy)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proof of stake consensus algorithms, the consensus algorithm does not solve puzzles in a race to be the first. The first step is to identify and allow a certain number of nodes to be part of the blockchain. This is called a permissioned blockchain because you need to have permission to partake. This permission is given by distributing stakes.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Proof of Stake consensus mechanism is solving a puzzle, but the puzzle contains only static elements - not variables - based on different characteristics:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The block number&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content (part) of blocks a long time ago (&amp;gt;2000 blocks)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transaction number (between the first and the last transaction) in the block of the stake transfer transaction all participating nodes needs to&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current timestamp
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All these numbers are fixed but the time stamp and every node in the block stake blockchain will solve this puzzle every second until the output of this puzzle matches the required difficulty level. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To make sure the one node that has solved the puzzle to match the difficulty level cannot introduce information in the block which allows him to tamper with the next blocks this node cannot use his used stake for a period amount of time for creating new blocks.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The fact that the puzzle-solving includes historic block data and once a node is assigned to create the block and put it on a chain will not be able to use that block state for a period of time makes it very costly to try to tamper with the content of the block (and the next blocks). &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-blockchain-dilemma-problem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-blockchain-dilemma-problem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-blockchain-dilemma-problem&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Blockchain Dilemma Problem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and private blockchains have their specific advantages and disadvantages and are very good for specific use cases - but not all. If we list the specifics of both we end up with a table like this:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
| * | Public Blockchains | Private Blockchains |
|‚Äî|‚Äî|‚Äî|
| Security | Provided by having a large number of nodes running it | Provided by having them in secure controlled places | 
| People | Build, managed and controlled by unknown people | Build, managed, and controlled by known people |&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
| Speed | Slow by design - all data needs to be copied to all of them | Fast(er) and more efficient by design - a smaller number of copies of the blockchain data |&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So what if we want to have a secure, performant, and easy to manage blockchain solution?  This is not what can be delivered by either type of blockchains.  We have to create a new type of blockchain that combines the best of both worlds and delivers.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The key element in finding a solution for this problem is to take the human element out of it.  The fact that when you deploy blockchains solutions in locations without human intervention means that you need to create a different deployment mechanism that takes out people touching code, compiling code, deploying code, and in the end operating the machine in which the code runs.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A way to get around the trusted people problem is to select a platform on which software can be downloaded, compiled, installed, and operated without human intervention.  Such a platform is a unique platform that has not been developed and launched. Such a platform would have to have the following characteristics. To make this system work and solve the blockchain dilemma we need to have three components working together in an orchestrated way.  The three elements are:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A (simple) operating system that does not allow local and remote logins - a closed operating system that receives instructions to launch or kill applications.  This operating system  needs to be stateless to keep as simple as possible: &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3Bot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A virtual system administrator that is able to perform system administration tasks to make the system operate, self-heal and execute instructions from authenticated and authorized sources.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-Chain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A ledger or database to store information with regards to authentication, operational and financial transactions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This system architecture allows for authenticated and trusted virtual system administrators to download, compile and deploy software on a grid of secure Zero-OS nodes with an immutable ledger that records all transactions, operational and financial. This presents a platform on which a public (permissioned) blockchain can be run securely without requiring trusted people to operate the nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In such architecture, we can build and deploy a high-performance secure blockchain which are the combined benefits of a public and private blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 1: Bigger data centers are more efficient&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are advantages in building larger-scale data centers, like economies of scale and sheer bulk buying power, but these are not as significant as what people think. The average cost per rack in a hyper-scale data center is $20-35K USD including all energy requirements and safety systems. The cost of hardware per rack is around the $200-300K USD mark.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
What is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and highly concentrated comes with complexity and specific problems to deal with. For example. resource requirements such as investment, operational costs, knowledge, and people increase significantly with size.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In reality, keeping things simple, small, and distributed is much more cost-effective than large complex environments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 2: Big data centers can be sustainable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon footprint of a big data center is enormous. To improve the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of most data center farmers have adopted wind, hydro, and&#x2F;or solar power technologies, which indeed helps drop their PUE by an estimated 20%. But is this leading to more sustainability?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This 20% looks great on paper and in the farmers‚Äô corporate social responsibility reports. However, it just represents an improvement in the cooling technology and sourcing of energy. It doesn‚Äôt actually impact the energy consumed by the equipment that runs in their data centers (servers, storage chassis, physical disks, etc.) which is the equipment responsible for the carbon footprint. PUE only refers to overhead power consumption, i.e. cooling the facility, opening, and closing doors, maintaining power security systems, etc.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual Internet capacity to run workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks, and storage cabinets. Improving on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of up to a thousand percent and lead to ten times more power-efficiency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 3: Redundant systems have better uptime&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of us believe that systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability. While it may make sense to IT experts, let‚Äôs translate this for the non-IT world?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To make a car more reliable we add redundancy (as we do in IT). So for the risk of having a puncture, we add one extra tire for all the tires we use continuously. This adds 4 extra tires to the car. Then a decision needs to be made: Do we put those tires in a structure where they are always running along with the primary tires or do we choose not to have them ‚Äúonline‚Äù all the time, wearing and tearing in the same way as the primary tires?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Building such a system would take a large number of engineers to come up with a solution, and would change cars as we know them. Wouldn‚Äôt it make more sense to think outside the box and solve the root of the problem by making tires un-deflatable?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The IT industry has gone overboard with the concept of redundancy, having forgotten to look at the root cause issues. This has spawned a whole new industry of itself, which has a financial interest in creating complicated and expensive redundant systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 4: Big companies optimize better&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big companies with a certain track record will know better how to optimize as they have more people and resources.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
At first glance, this sounds logical, but in reality, ninety percent of the innovation within the IT space comes from startups. The giant IT companies have a heritage they hardly can overcome. They are locked in old infrastructure designs, and building outside of that infrastructure would be costly, timely, and probably put the breaks on their businesses.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Real innovation gives way to fix the core symptoms rather than taking the problem pain-killer approach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The need for ThreeFold&#x27;s neutral internet</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
**The Internet is growing like crazy and is now a trillion dollar problem. Together we can build a new neutral Internet.**
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-introduction-to-the-problems&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-introduction-to-the-problems&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-introduction-to-the-problems&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An introduction to the problems&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Internet is no longer the neutral place it used to be. +80% of the Internet capacity is delivered by a handful of companies. This results in a loss of neutrality and openness and breeds inequalities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To support the continuous growth of the Internet and connect billions to new Internet Of Things devices, 400 million new servers are needed by 2020. The world therefore needs another 4,000 large-scale data centers that each consume 200 MWe of electricity: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1UPUZYG&quot;&gt;see source&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today, about 4 billion people have no access to the Internet due to the high costs of connectivity and capacity. We believe these people have the fundamental right to have low-cost access to digital resources such as online identity solutions, education, health information and more. For this to happen, solutions that can lower the cost by a factor of 10 are required.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bandwidth does not follow Moore‚Äôs law. The growth of bandwidth required is much higher than the speed at which new capacity can be delivered. This is even more important in emerging markets.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current blockchain technology is not scalable and not sustainable. Example: the Bitcoin blockchain alone uses more energy today than Croatia.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;current-internet-and-cloud-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#current-internet-and-cloud-capacity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: current-internet-and-cloud-capacity&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Current Internet and Cloud capacity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the cloud computing industry represents a 100 billion dollar industry - mostly owned by about 20 global cooperations. Experts such as Bell Labs and Cisco believe the capacity requirements in the next decade will dramatically exceed existing infrastructure - requiring many more data centers and billions, if not trillions in investments.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The spectacular growth and advancements in cloud computing that occurred over the last decade resulted in large part from ‚Äúhyper-scale‚Äù efficiencies - i.e. centralizing Internet infrastructure in very large billion dollar data centers.  However, demand for Internet capacity already surpassed the available infrastructure with emerging technologies such as Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Technology. The existing hyperscale cloud architecture cannot cope with this growing demand as the requirements for land, power and funding are becoming outrageous.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The challenges facing the Internet includes the following:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trillions of Investment Required&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. In the next decade, the global Internet infrastructure requires another 4,000 data centers (250M - 1B dollar investment each) to meet demand which would cost trillions - this money could be better used in education, healthcare, or sustainable innovations. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impossible to scale the networks connecting users to the hyperscale data centers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Since hyperscale data centers are built in large ‚Äúcentral‚Äù locations, the network leading to these data centers is congested. Even more, remote regions that are less connected to the Internet cannot benefit from these data centers‚Äô IT services.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-local data and capacity&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. Governments around the world are becoming more and more concerned about data leaving their borders. To tackle this centralization issue, they would need local IT infrastructure. Also, IoT workloads need local capacity to deliver constant real-time computing and storage requirements - for certain applications and workloads (e.g. driverless cars), latency is not an option. Hyperscale data centers can simply not match these requirements.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not secure &#x2F; at risk of choke point failures&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. There are plenty of recent well-publicized problems around security, outages and loss of data. The reason for this is that centralized hyperscale architectures are inherently insecure - and failures at a single hyperscale location can cause widespread contagion and outages.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-solution&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution to these trillion dollar problems is to migrate Internet capacity to the Edge (closer to user location) - i.e. a ‚Äúhyper-distributed‚Äù network architecture, located close to users (in cities, schools, offices, homes and even vehicles).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Edge networks will not necessarily replace the existing hyperscale capacity powering today‚Äôs cloud - rather, they will scale to meet the increased capacity demands going forward. However, if the current hyperscale capacity can be decentralized to improve energy consumption and reduce costs, this would be a huge global success.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By 2025, 60% of new Internet infrastructure will be decentralized and located at the edge of operator networks by using alternative locations which have stable (renewable) power and reliable connectivity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The ThreeFold Grid is distributed and benefits from our ItsYou.Online identity management platform - making it much more secure.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The solution enables to bring capacity closer to where users are located, enabling a Cloud at the Edge.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The technology removes the need to build huge power hungry datacenters and by decentralizing the architecture enables up-to 1000% energy savings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making IT a true utility&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:  We always approached IT as Energy. Today we provide 3x more uptime and between 3-10x more cost effectiveness.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutrality&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The solution enables 100% neutral &amp;amp; private Internet IT capacity. Our blockchain technology provides security, neutrality &amp;amp; scale.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-zero-node&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-zero-node&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-zero-node&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Zero-Node&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zero-Node provides compute, network and storage capacity to the internet and ThreeFold‚Äôs blockchain. This capacity can be used for any possible workload. Here are some characteristics of ThreeFold‚Äôs Zero node:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modularity&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Scaling from 8 vCPUs and 3.5 TB of storage (smallest) to clusters with 8000 vCPUs and 2 PB of storage (large), there is a range of possibilities at hand.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Storing the hardware uses about 10x less energy, and about 2-3x for other workloads.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralized&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The Zero Operating System (‚ÄúZero OS‚Äù) is ideally suited for Edge networking - where automation, self-healing and hyper-distribution are must-haves.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Zero-Nodes are deployed as close as possible to the consumers of Internet IT capacity (IoT, residential, business, government, education, ‚Ä¶).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This results in massive bandwidth savings, we estimate to be able to keep 99% of the required bandwidth locally which has a huge impact on cost.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the only viable solution to be able to provide internet to the 3.2 billion people waiting.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self healing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The architecture is designed to ensure that workloads and data can be accessed at all times. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral &amp;amp; private&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A lot of work has done using blockchain (technology which powers crypto currency) to guarantee privacy and net neutrality.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed around simplicity to be used by everyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
