		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s the beginning of another year, so I thought it would be a good time to put things into perspective with where we are and where we’re going.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-today&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-today&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-today&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Today&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest. There is no other project or technology out there like ThreeFold, no one nearly as far along as we are. Our co-founders have decades of experience (and success) in the Internet and Cloud space. They and the team developed a new Internet infrastructure from the ground up, including a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__zos&quot;&gt;stateless operating system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on the Linux kernel, which is quite a significant accomplishment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we have the biggest network of decentralized storage, compute, and network on the planet. The technology is in its third generation, functional and ready for utilization, even commercially. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provides a sandbox of limitless opportunities for open-source builders – developers can (and are) now build(ing) and monetize(ing) projects built on the grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you’ve been following along lately with community calls and all of our updates to see the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;end-of-year-2022-community-call-recording&#x2F;3636&quot;&gt;major progress that was made in 2022&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The technology took major strides, the grid nearly doubled, the community got way more active, and there are some partnerships in the works with huge reach where we can make big impact.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the token price is low and this is less than ideal to say the least, especially for farmers who are running hardware and weary of costs – although a power savings feature is coming! But the token is built on strong fundamentals and our efforts are focused on creating a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-new-financial-system-is-needed-for-a-better-future&#x2F;3547&quot;&gt;balanced and sustainable token economy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the long-term.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-tomorrow&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-tomorrow&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-tomorrow&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Tomorrow&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming days we’ll be announcing a super exciting project (ThreeFold Grid Services) from the ThreeFold team with the following purpose:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To prove that the current state of the ThreeFold Grid is enough on top of which to start an end-user facing commercial business. We will release a suite of grid services with fiat gateways and we will also create content that explains in steps how to use the technical building blocks to put it all together to create your own solution &#x2F; service.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within Q1 we also aim to expose one or several partnerships with the potential to impact millions of people in emerging &#x2F; developing countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have ThreeFold Ventures coming as well, different businesses or arms of ThreeFold including OurPhone that create a holistic ecosystem for a more fair and equal world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-of-internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Regional Internet) model which will come to life this year, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;digital-twin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Digital Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And more – this is not comprehensive – but you get the picture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-beyond&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-beyond&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-beyond&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Beyond&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is the foundation for people around the world to live in true digital sovereignty, for people who today do not have affordable access to education, communication, and financial tools to gain access. ThreeFold can impact industries from Internet to banking to education to supply chain and more. The possibilities are really limitless, let your imagine run wild. ThreeFold can change the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-future-is-up-to-all-of-us&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#our-future-is-up-to-all-of-us&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: our-future-is-up-to-all-of-us&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Our Future Is up to All of Us&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve said this before, I’ll say it again (and again) … A decentralized movement is all about decentralized action and participation. And participation comes in all shapes and sizes. Together, we all need to act and push this into the world. Everyone in this community is empowered to help the project succeed though their own initiatives. The team is of course happy to offer support through technical help and even token grants. ThreeFold will be a success if people continue to choose to believe it is important and dedicate their energy towards it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold can and needs to be a complete, end-to-end decentralized ecosystem empowering all its members to build and create. We have everything we need, and if we don’t, let’s solve it. Most importantly, we have each other. Let’s do this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to get involved, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&quot;&gt;forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;two-way chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldfarmers&quot;&gt;farmers chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;library&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &#x2F; &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;&quot;&gt;manual&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are great places to get started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralised-internet-india/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-decentralisation-of-the-internet-help-india&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-would-decentralisation-of-the-internet-help-india&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-would-decentralisation-of-the-internet-help-india&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How would Decentralisation of the Internet help India?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashish Bansal has been a member of the ThreeFold support team since October 2021. He was born in India. Ashish believes that we all deserve a better internet which is free, decentralized and equal for all.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become one of the most important aspects of human life. Our everyday lives are impacted by social media and other online platforms on a very minute level. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and others have become the most convenient way to stay in touch with friends and family. WhiteHart, Udemy and others have made quality education accessible to all. Swiggy, Zomato and others have made our favourite cuisine accessible at home. Amazon, Flipkart and others have grown the shopping experience for Indians with a variety of choices. Netflix, Hotstar, Youtube and others have made entertainment on demand easy for us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, we have all gotten addicted to the comforts that the internet has brought to us, and it wouldn’t be wrong for us to say that we cannot imagine our lives without the internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Indian internet usage ranks second in the world today behind China, with 43% of its total population online, this also means that there is still a lot of untapped potential in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;issues-with-current-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#issues-with-current-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: issues-with-current-internet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Issues with current Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the internet has helped us in making our lives comfortable, there are several issues with the current Internet services we use. Some of them are mentioned below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;cyber-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#cyber-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: cyber-security&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Cyber security&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyber security infrastructure in India today is not well equipped to tackle increasing cyber-crimes. You may not have the resolution to your complaints filed with Cyber Cell Portals on time. Hence there is an increasing number of fraudsters and hackers in India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-ownership&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#data-ownership&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: data-ownership&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Data ownership&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal details shared by you on the internet are used by big companies to influence your decision-making process strategically.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;higher-cost-to-customers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#higher-cost-to-customers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: higher-cost-to-customers&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Higher cost to customers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since internet infrastructure is owned and controlled by a few big companies, there is an irregular price increase which makes the internet unaffordable to many parts of rural India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralised-internet-is-the-solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralised-internet-is-the-solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralised-internet-is-the-solution&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralised Internet is the solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralisation of the internet refers to the arrangement of the internet or its components such that no single entity or organization has control or authority over the network. It  holds the potential to revolutionize the way every nation accesses and utilizes the world wide web. India, one of the biggest players in the digital world, can greatly benefit from Internet decentralization. It would open up many new opportunities for both the country and its citizens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, decentralization of the internet would give India more control over its digital landscape. Instead of relying on a single, centralized entity to power its network, India could decentralize its internet and make the administration of the network much more efficient. With this additional control and efficiency, India could develop a more secure and reliable infrastructure, while also controlling the delivery of services. This could lead to faster, more reliable connection speeds, along with increased safety and security.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, decentralization of the internet would allow India to establish itself as a technological leader. By decentralizing the internet, India could shift its focus from the existing internet infrastructure to developing innovative technology and applications. This could include the development of decentralized artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and much more. Potential applications of these technologies could drastically improve the education, healthcare, and transportation sectors of India.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, decentralization of the internet could help with digital media access and distribution. This could open up new opportunities for providing access to digital media in rural areas, allowing for more effective access to education and entertainment. Furthermore, it could also provide access to more reliable payment services, as well as better consumer protection policies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, decentralization of the internet holds the potential to greatly benefit India and its citizens. It would give India control over its internet infrastructure, opening the door for development of innovative technologies and applications. Additionally, it could provide more effective access to digital media, along with more reliable payment services and consumer protection policies. In order for India to take full advantage of the potential of decentralization of the internet, it must take decisive steps towards implementing the necessary reforms and investments to ensure its success.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-threefold-can-contribute&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-threefold-can-contribute&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-threefold-can-contribute&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How ThreeFold can contribute&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold technology runs on the concept of a grid formed by farmers who are independent people, unlike big corporations, that connect their nodes anywhere network and electricity is present to create a global distributed internet infrastructure. This resolves the problem of monopoly and price of big internet companies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology also ensures that you get data security which was how the internet was originally intended to be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-review-2022-preview-2023/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year marked by significant steps on technology, big strides towards decentralization, a commitment to our values (planet, people, and authenticity), time well-spent on the ground, and strong contributions from the community. Let’s take a look back at all that ThreeFold held space for this year.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-grid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grid has grown significantly this year, with a whopping total of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;grid-stats-new-nodes-utilization-overview&#x2F;3291&#x2F;33&quot;&gt;2900+ online nodes as of this week&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The farming community is contributing capacity across 62 countries, made up of nearly 72,000 Cores and providing nearly 40PB of storage capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, we officially said goodbye to Grid v2, which was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;discontinuation-grid-v2&#x2F;3385&quot;&gt;discontinued&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, along with all platforms no longer needed on v3. Farewell old friend!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks to our motivated team and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldtesting&quot;&gt;testing community&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the grid evolved from version 3.0 to 3.7.1, and soon &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tf-product-updates-december-2022-tfgrid-v3-8-0-updates&#x2F;3654&quot;&gt;3.8&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Each update included improvements to various ThreeFold Grid components including the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Zero-OS, TF Wallet, TF Chain and more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all of our farmers for upholding &amp;amp; expanding the Grid! It was beautiful to see the community growth and engagement on both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldfarmers&quot;&gt;chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;farming&#x2F;42&quot;&gt;the forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Our developers worked very hard to make it manageable from the chain. While they got it to work recently, the solution was not the most ideal one, therefore, the team is rethinking this feature as a service that a farmer can choose to run for their farm rather than something that happens entirely on TF Chain. Stay updated &amp;amp; contribute to this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;home&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1371&quot;&gt;on GitHub&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decentralization is at the core of ThreeFold and creates resilience while involving the community in the decision-making process, leading to wider ownership and greater engagement. In 2022, we took great steps towards true decentralization, and will continue to take this path next year!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several Grid Enhancement Proposals were made and voted on by the community around the grid and farming.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, we officially introduced the validator program, which will come to fruition in 2023.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the token price has been low this year, it presents a great opportunity for believers to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_ecosystem&quot;&gt;buy TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, it became possible to buy TFT directly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;get-tft-directly-with-btc&#x2F;1825&quot;&gt;with BTC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (Bitcoin) as well as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tft-fiat-gateway-beta-testing-program&#x2F;2746&quot;&gt;with fiat currencies through the Mercuryo gateway&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, we’ll be introducing TFT-fiat gateways into the Mastodon weblet (see below) and across the whole grid ecosystem to make it even easier to use grid services.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As believers in truly decentralized models, we have repeatedly questioned how to exist without centralized exchanges. In August, TFT was &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tft-will-be-delisted-on-liquid-what-now-and-what-next&#x2F;3197&quot;&gt;delisted from the Liquid Exchange&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the result of their acquisition by FTX earlier this year. A blessing in disguise, after seeing the monumental &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;on-the-ftx-crash-and-the-tft-model&#x2F;3524&quot;&gt;FTX crash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which affected Liquid (which could have resulted in a loss of funds, although the exchange Liquid “hopes to return customer funds in 2023”) and sent ripple effects across the entire industry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of our aim next year will be to introduce concepts like the liquidity pool and P2P DeFi wallet to provide a resilient, sustainable, and native &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-new-financial-system-is-needed-for-a-better-future&#x2F;3547&quot;&gt;financial system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the Internet of Internets, which strengthens the foundation of the ecosystem by enhancing the stability and liquidity of the ThreeFold Token.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We doubled down on commitment to follow our values, particularly when it comes to collaborations and partnerships.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ThreeFold signed a Head of Terms in December 2022 to officialize a public-private-partnership with a country in East Africa in Q1 2023. This partnership will support the roll out of a decentralized Internet infrastructure to support fintech services, e-residency and more.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a fast-moving and ever-changing world, it is our belief that ThreeFold is one of the few projects out there that can genuinely enable a better future. We are driven by our mission and vision, guided by our values, and upheld by our global community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023 will be about continuing to improve the technology and simplify the grid experience, bringing to life the Regional Internets and Digital Twin concepts, introducing partnerships we’ve been alluding to this year, and furthering the decentralization of ThreeFold by empowering the community to take action independently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is all of ours, and as a decentralized movement, we all share the responsibility to drive this project forward in meaningful ways to the best of our own abilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is the future. Based on decentralization and open source paradigms, we are a strong movement that continues to grow resilience. We are hungry for a better tomorrow, and ready to continue the journey towards the actualization of our common vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter becoming official at the end of October, many people have become uncomfortable with the idea of a single controversial billionaire with a lot on his plate having that level of power over a platform used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide – making decisions that look to be putting the company, the platform, and its users in jeopardy, at least in the short term.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the acquisition and a series of events thereafter, millions of Twitter users have started looking for a replacement, with more than one million people flocking to the leading decentralized Twitter alternative, Mastodon, over the past two weeks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;mastodon_users.png&quot; alt=&quot;mastodon_users&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time we’ve seen the alarm bells ring, a mass exodus from a top social networking site or communication platform. (And by the way, it won’t be the last.) As an example, last year after WhatsApp announced some changes to its terms of service, tens of millions of new accounts were created on Signal and Telegram. And earlier this year, Facebook reported a loss in daily active users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that most platforms are owned &amp;amp; controlled by the few. And it actually goes further than just platforms: the way the infrastructure of the current internet model is built, its foundational layers, are controlled by the few as well. Think about it, as ‘users’ of platforms, browsers, websites, etc., we have become the product, or rather, our data has become the product.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted advertising, cookies, geo-localisation. Agenda setting might have been ignited in the newspaper industry hundreds of years ago, but it definitely reached the Internet. When you search for something on the web, through most browsers &amp;amp; platforms, the outcomes you get are the result of an agenda setting. This means that a few decide which information is more important than the other. Often, this decision is subjective, and influenced by the highest bids to get on top of the list.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s happening with Twitter is just the latest warning of the dangers of the centralized Internet, and the fact that people are leaving is the latest signal that the world is increasingly ready for a decentralized digital world. People aren’t just boycotting social media, they are leaving to go somewhere else considered ‘better’. They are migrating to Mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-makes-mastodon-a-viable-alternative-to-twitter&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What makes Mastodon a viable alternative to Twitter?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon has a lot of the same functionalities as Twitter, such as replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hash tags. However, it is not owned or operated by any one organization. Instead, it’s made up of lots of different servers (also called “instances”), all talking to one another. The service describes itself as a “federated network which operates in a similar way to email.” And as it is open source, Mastodon allows for anyone to download, modify, &amp;amp; install Mastodon on their own servers. Pretty nifty, right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;mastodon.png&quot; alt=&quot;mastodon&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon was created in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike most popular social media sites, like Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn, Mastodon is a nonprofit. As such, its goal is to benefit the public rather than shareholders. Twitter has built up a reputation for being the “watercooler of the world”. While it would be quite a task for Mastodon to replicate that feat at scale, many people might prefer the latter for a number of reasons, like:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control over your timeline: No algorithm dictating what you’ll see – and no advertisements&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not for Sale: “We will never serve ads or push profiles for you to see. That means your data and your time are yours and yours alone.” - Mastodon&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of moderation: Individual communities may create their own content guidelines, offering a variety of different user experiences. Join a server with the rules you agree with, or host your own!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralization: Each Mastodon server is a completely independent entity, able to interoperate with others to form one global social network. Anybody can deploy Mastodon on their own infrastructure, under no third-party control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source: Mastodon believes in the right to use, copy, study and change Mastodon as one sees fit, since everyone benefits from contributions from the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interoperable: Built on open web protocols, Mastodon can speak with any other platform that implements ActivityPub. With one account, users get access to a whole universe of social apps—the Fediverse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-mastodon-threefold-align&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-do-mastodon-threefold-align&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-do-mastodon-threefold-align&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How do Mastodon &amp;amp; ThreeFold Align?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening with Twitter is a reflection of the entire Internet model. Now, more and more people are opening their eyes to the shared fundamentals of decentralization and open source, which are paradigms shared by ThreeFold &amp;amp; Mastodon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where centralization is the default way of operating, we tend to be relatively oblivious to what it entails. Being part of a centralized Internet ultimately makes us dependent on the relative few that dictate our digital lives. By moving away, through decentralization, we can take control of our digital lives again.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;twitter_vs_internet.png&quot; alt=&quot;twitter_vs_internet&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastodon and the whole Fediverse have already attracted incredible communities with similar values and mindsets as that of ThreeFold and our community. Everyone joining Mastodon is looking for decentralization – whether they know it or not. Really, this mass exodus from Twitter is more proof (a la people leaving Facebook in droves or moving from WhatsApp to other messaging tools) that the world is increasingly ready for decentralization and what ThreeFold enables.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Twitter for Mastodon is a step in the right direction, but if you are really alarmed by what has been happening with this Twitter saga, we are here to invite you to take action and be a part of a better Internet system. We can build this together!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-threefold-support-mastodon&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-can-threefold-support-mastodon&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-can-threefold-support-mastodon&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How can ThreeFold support Mastodon?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold provides a reliable decentralized infrastructure that Mastodon and the rest of the platforms within the Fediverse need, and we believe that those communities will be very interested in our broader vision as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Movement is collectively building an Internet by the people for the people, from the infrastructure level up to the experiences. You can plug in hardware, join the ThreeFold Grid, and provide decentralized Internet capacity for the communities around you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ThreeFold offers three main solutions to the growing Mastodon community:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deployment&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: ThreeFold is making it very easy for anyone and everyone to create their own server through the ThreeFold Playground, so they are in full control. And it’s on decentralized infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;True Co-Ownership&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: We’ll make it possible to co-own communities via smart contract, so if some nodes leave or go offline, the server is still viable. So any group of people can chip in some money and co-own your own Mastodon server. By creating your own community, as of Grid 3.8, you will also be able to ask people for contributions in order to operate the server, etc. And you can set and maintain your own moderation standards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Flexible (Secure) Login&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Lastly, we’re going to focus on authentication. Today it’s only email based, which means it’s easy for people to hide. ThreeFold could enable different verification options – email-based, TF Connect, and even TF Connect + KYC. So each server can have their own standards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-threefold-already-doing-to-make-this-happen&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is ThreeFold already doing to make this happen?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently the team is working on an easy-to-deploy weblet so that anybody can easily launch their own instance of Mastodon running on top of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a plan for people to be able to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-to-deploy-mastadon-on-the-threefold-grid-today&#x2F;3487&quot;&gt;deploy their own Mastodon servers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for free.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a website re: Mastodon + ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached out to the Mastodon team (We have done this officially, but we can do more of it from more angles).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating plenty of content on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;threefold-grid-utilization&#x2F;fediverse&#x2F;113&quot;&gt;forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (e.g. open letter to Mastodon community), posting on social media, finding and engaging with public conversations about Mastodon on Twitter (something we can all do).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held a Community Call around Mastodon &amp;amp; the Fediverse to discuss in further details what has been mentioned in this blog. Find a recording of it &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;mastodon-the-fediverse-community-call-recording&#x2F;3522&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

The team found so much value within it that we felt it was important to give it a permanent space within the ThreeFold Blogs collection, and Drew agreed to this. Besides a few grammatical corrections and minor contextual tweaks, the content has not been edited – and you can find the original post &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;DrewSmith214&#x2F;comments&#x2F;yhym2f&#x2F;an_organization_building_a_decentralized_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings fellow decentralization lovers, I am in search of people looking to contribute to what is now the largest decentralized network in the world, working towards the goal of providing a decentralized internet that breaks down barriers to information and compute resource access. Our network provides digital equality to all users while placing the control of their data back into their hands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project I’m discussing is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Threefold.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this is a project that currently has nearly 3000 Bare-Metal** **nodes in 64 countries allowing anyone in the world to deploy an industry standard VPS on the decentralized infrastructure with no involvement of the centralized cloud providers, This is a network meant to be used by everyone that can be expanded by anyone. You can check out a current map of the nodes online on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dashboard.grid.tf&#x2F;explorer&#x2F;statistics&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Explorer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid consists of three synergistic layers: The Nodes, The Network, and the BlockChain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Nodes:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; These are hardware that gives its grid its power, The requirements for running a 3Node are a bare metal x86_64 machine and a reliable internet connection. These nodes can be hosted in a variety of environments spanning at home deployments to rented-space DC’s. This includes DC’s themselves being able to bring capacity online so long as it’s a fully bare metal device.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;plug and play solutions&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for bringing a 3Node online on the [3Node marketplace](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.3node.global&#x2F;index.php?dispatch= categories.view&amp;amp;category_id=167), this marketplace includes node offerings from both the organizations itself as well as multiple independent businesses that have become certified 3Node Resellers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with the concepts of building a server&#x2F;pc you can also bring your hardware online as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;D.I.Y 3Node&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; this allows you to contribute any additional hardware you may have in your deployment to the support of both the grids network and compute capacity. you can find documentation on D.I.Y nodes on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;diy-nodes-guide&#x2F;837&quot;&gt;Forums&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or in the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__diy_guide&quot;&gt;Wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each node is booted using a fully in house developed autonomous operating system that automates both node deployment and workloads being deployed on the node after its online, called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;zos&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This OS is a hypervisor environment that accepts commands from and is managed by the block-chain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Network(s):&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The grid is supported by multiple internal and external networks that allow for the nodes to function as a decentralized data center. This is made of two major components.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Z-Net&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;- is an internal private overlay network between VMs, Kubernetes Nodes, Containers and the grid. This network allows for minimal usage of Public ipv4 space while still allowing for global deployment solutions encompassing multiple 3Nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planetary Network-&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; This is a peer to peer end to encrypted network solution based on opensource technologies (yggdrasil) that allow grid users to create, develop and overlay networks designed to protect users ability to communicate and access information. You can find the github Repo &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;planetary_network&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, with 3000 endpoints all controlled by a single DAO, the potential exists to create the most reliable peer to peer mesh in existence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public IPv4-&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Threefold farmers have the ability to add Public Ipv4 to the grid in addition to their compute capacity, these IPs can be deployed as gateway addresses in support of the grid, or rented by end users for their workloads, at the time of this writing the threefold grid has 1114 Public Ipv4 addresses available for use. you can find documentation on adding I.P addresses to the grid &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;diy-public-node-guide&#x2F;3340&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BlockChain:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; the blockchain technologies built into the Threefold Grid represent what makes the grid truly unique and allows it to be utilized to support customer facing workloads or provide a decentralized compute resource pool. grid utilization is supported and created through two avenues&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individuals:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; can deploy any workload they need on any node on the grid, if it can run on Linux it can run on the grid, this type of use is supported by the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;#&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Threefold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a decentralized deployment solution that provides industry standard Linux vps deployments as multiple use case specific deployment solutions for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;caprover.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Caprover&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;joinpeertube.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Peertube&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;funkwhale.audio&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Funkwhale&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mattermost.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Mattermost&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discourse.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Discourse&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taiga.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Taiga&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;owncloud.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Owncloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearch.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Presearch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subsquid.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;SubSquid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casperlabs.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CasperLabs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodepilot.tech&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Node Pilot&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom VM images cab be uploaded to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Threefold Hub&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; allowing full deployment customization with any Linux os image supporting cloud-init. Documentation on creating custom images can be found &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;manipulating-cloud-images-for-the-grid&#x2F;3380&quot;&gt;On the Forums&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage workloads can be deployed using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;terraform-provider-grid&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with offerings of HDD, SSD and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;terraform-provider-grid&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File Storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Providers&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: these are developers of user facing services that utilize the grid as their hosting platform. These organizations&#x2F;individuals are able to develop customized solutions that provide needed services in their market and receive rewards for the utilization that their developments bring. A great example of this is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zonaris.con&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zonaris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is a third party organization that is quickly taking the lead in grid solution development. They have recently released an interface that allows end users to deploy &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamr.network&#x2F;discover&#x2F;network&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Streamr&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nodes on the Threefold grid while paying in fiat currency. you can get started with them at &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;get.zonaris.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Get Zonaris&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows developers to invest in only their code while having the infrastructure of a worldwide virtual data center at their disposal to scale their solutions with their business needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution providers are able to automate their tools being deployed on the grid using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldtech&#x2F;terraform-provider-grid&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this has all truly come together to form is an organization where anyone can contribute to building a more private and secure internet that is designed to allow universal access to information and compute power regardless of the end user’s nationality or beliefs. Threefold truly exists to capitalize on the ideal economies from every corner of the world, in order to provide a better digital future for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Can You Do?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what you see today at Threefold.io is the work of 100s of decentralized contributors working together towards a common goal. The grid is designed so that anyone can contribute whether you’re a developer, a property owner, an I.S.P, or just someone with a spare computer and a network connection. As it stands the grid is strong and well supported across the world. The biggest impact that can be made today is by developing solutions that leverage the grid and use its resources to bring affordable and accessible hosting to end users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many discussions happening on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&quot;&gt;Threefold Forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about partnerships with other projects and how we can better support both the crypto landscape and the general internet user base. Even by just joining discussions on the Threefold Forum and providing your input and ideas you can help to make sure that the internet of tomorrow is built for and by the users of tomorrow. but there are lots of ways to contribute:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can purchase the TFT token following &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-as-a-tool-for-humanity/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-as-a-tool-for-humanity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#technology-as-a-tool-for-humanity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: technology-as-a-tool-for-humanity&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Technology as a tool for humanity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology… In today’s world, technology holds a central role. Younger generations in developed countries grow up amidst technological wonders of all sorts, truly immersed in an evolving digital landscape. Any information is a click away, offering immense intellectual capital unlike ever before – and on the other hand, great distraction, misinformation, and potential for division.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is a word dating back to the early 17th century, formed from the Greek &lt;em&gt;tekhnologia&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; meaning ‘systematic treatment,’ itself formed from &lt;em&gt;tekhnē&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; meaning ‘art, craft.’ Technology is the application of knowledge to reach practical goals in a specifiable and reproducible way. The word technology may also mean the product of such an endeavor, as it is mostly used today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As technologies enter our world they either add on incrementally to already existing technologies (i.e., tablets) or shake everything up (i.e., television). Technology can be found in most industries and at different levels, ranging from vehicles to home appliances, passing through healthcare, education, and even entertainment. Sometimes technology replaces human labor by replicating it, other times it facilitates processes and makes labor less intensive. Some technology even surpasses human precision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While technology has had an important role in the creation of today’s societies, it might have an even greater role for our future. Two opposite pictures could be painted: a utopia or a dystopia. The utopia of a world full of values-driven, well-constructed technologies promises an increased quality of life for all, with digital tools which, for instance, could provide or enable equal educational opportunities for all, mobility everywhere, a universal basic income and the promise of never having to work again (e.g. in the sense of wage labor).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a dystopia could be the result of reckless technological advancement. Questions are raised, like, will most jobs be dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) in 20 years? Will privacy become a myth, with personal data being controlled by a handful? Will consumerism rule societies and reinforce social struggles?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One technology that has been slowly taking the dystopian route is the Internet. While major Internet and Cloud infrastructure advancements were made since the beginning of the millennium through hyper-scale data centers, the current Internet infrastructure model has many flaws:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is centralized&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The GAFAM (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft) own 80% of the global compute, storage and network infrastructures. Also the global infrastructure is concentrated in the U.S in large majority, as well as Europe and China.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is inefficient&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Most of the data centers are located in the U.S, forcing the rest of the world to connect via Internet sea cables and having their data flowing outside of their borders and back.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not scalable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Emerging technologies require the global Internet infrastructure to triple in size in the next 4 years. It took 20+ years to build the current Internet infrastructure. So, we need to build 3 times more in 5 times less time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not affordable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: It costs billions of dollars and enormous amounts of energy and time to build, manage and productize hyper-scale data centers. Only the richest countries in the world build data centers and the rest of the world become their clients.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not private&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Anyone can access Google Chrome or Facebook for free. But as outlined by movies such as the Social Dilemma or The Great Hack, if it is free, you are the product. The web’s Ad model is threatening our privacy and the net neutrality of the global internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not secure&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The current IT stack depends on human error and it has been considered as the major cause of cybersecurity breaches with more than 95% of the cases. Human errors allow attackers to access encrypted channels and sensitive information&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is not sustainable:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; Data centers are extremely power hungry, consuming over 2 trillion gigabytes of storage and consuming around 205 TWh - More than the State of New York. According to statistics, the Internet consumes between 10-20% of global energy resources.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It cannot support future demand:&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; To meet projected demand for 2022, more than 4,000 new data centers, costing an estimated $5 trillion, will be needed to build and consume an additional 400 GW&#x2F;h. This is roughly equivalent to Japan’s energy consumption and would place an impossible strain on the global electricity grid. The rising demand for Internet storage is already causing hardware shortages and price hikes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ThreeFold, we want to encourage the creation of a utopian future driven by thoughtful technology. Our founders took part in the way the Internet was created, full of beautiful promises, and have seen first-hand how those promises have been corrupted throughout its evolution. By building a new Internet infrastructure from scratch, ThreeFold goes back to those original promises while having learnt from the development mistakes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristof, our CEO, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@despiegk&#x2F;once-upon-a-time-only-30-years-ago-an-experiment-started-called-the-internet-5251e0da6a76&quot;&gt;wrote in a blog&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Internet allows the expansion of our village life to become a global community. It allows us to act as a global tribe with all information at our fingertips, it offers the possibility to get equal access to all planet resources. It has the promise for global free communication, instant availability of information, unlimited opportunities for growth and education. But what happened to our Beautiful Internet?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Internet allowed us to become more efficient in depriving mother earth from her resources. It allowed us to become more addicted to immediate gratification, examples are social media networks and the adult entertainment industry. Beautiful new possibilities like digital currencies became a gambling game and a source of wealth for the smartest hackers. The communication capabilities of the Internet allowed the few to manipulate the many.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By putting people, planet and authenticity at the core of the development of our technology, we want to gift societes a remade internet. Features of this technology include sovereignty &amp;amp; decentralization, security &amp;amp; privacy, unlimited scalability, green &amp;amp; self healing properties, cost effectiveness, and reliability. The human is put at the center of our Internet model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology should not be a tool to extort humanity, but one at the service of humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-a-digital-twin&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-a-digital-twin&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-a-digital-twin&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is a Digital Twin?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current Internet system, each of us exists many times, each application provider owns &lt;em&gt;our&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; data while offering functionality &lt;em&gt;they&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; own. We become the user. We become the product. Instead, what if we were at the center of our digital lives?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web4 Digital Twin architecture does just that: it puts us at the center of our digital experience. Indeed, Digital Twin is a user-centric technological platform to build efficient, sovereign and secure digital experiences. Digital Twin technology empowers people and businesses to exchange information and value without any intermediaries, while making applications more scalable, efficient and secure than on any other web paradigm such as Web2, Web3 or Web5. Digital Twins require a decentralized Internet infrastructure and run perfectly on top of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: your-digital-twin-is-a-mirror-of-yourself&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Your Digital Twin is a mirror of yourself!&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your Digital Twin runs on a location of your choice, which becomes your personal Internet Gateway. Each Twin is owned by only one owner, who in the end is more like the human mirror to the Twin. The Twin has lots of capabilities and is available for its “human mirror” 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Experiences are being built which use the capabilities of the Twin. A Twin owns your data and your identity, all stored in such a way it can never be corrupted or lost. Thus, you own your data, your identity and your digital skills for all your life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;your-digital-twin-has-capabilities&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#your-digital-twin-has-capabilities&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: your-digital-twin-has-capabilities&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Your Digital Twin has Capabilities&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twins are powerful and have many capabilities which are used when they enter an experience. Here are the capabilities of the Digital Twin:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat, video conference, send messages to anyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create content, any content (metaverse, video, websites, …)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share and Promote
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your creations to the rest of the world&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote your products and services&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share your knowledge and help others to grow&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover and Learn
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find information, alternative indexing engine (neutral)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know what is truthful and what is not (proof of authenticity)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn and become smarter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economy
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage my digital wealth (digital currencies)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exchange anything for anything else (money for tokens, services, products)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy&#x2F;Sell goods and services&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I collaborate on documents, images, videos, code, …&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I manage a project, plan events, define deadlines&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your agenda and time&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organize your digital content so you can find it back, and it’s nicely organized&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your circles (groups of people)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that only the right people have access to your digital assets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if you die, make sure your loved ones can inherit your digital assets&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your digital life is secure (give access to your assets to your circles)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give proof of authenticity to assets and information from others&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and Expand
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code and extend the Twin (improve Twin capabilities for yourself and others)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create your own experiences&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twin has basic capabilities listed above which are strongly version controlled, but contributions from the global community are more than welcomed. The idea is to create a system which is simply good enough for any possible experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;your_digital_twin.png&quot; alt=&quot;Your Digital Twin&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very different paradigm compared to current web or mobile applications where capabilities are owned by the provider of the application. Besides, rather than survival of the fittest, we believe in a system of collaboration, where we invite everyone to make the system better so it fits us all. We don’t need three chat systems, we need one which is usable by thousands of experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers can create experiences re-using the open source capabilities the Twin offers, also eliminating the need to reinvent features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-on-connection-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#note-on-connection-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: note-on-connection-security&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Note on Connection &amp;amp; Security&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a “user”, you can use any browser to access experiences built on top of your Digital Twin. For example, a storage experience that stores data on your Twin or a browser experience that allows you to surf the web from your Twin’s node. When you connect to your Twin, our &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;web4&#x2F;threefold__threefold_connect&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Connect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; makes sure that the connection is secure. The Twin runs on a node on the ThreeFold Grid, which you are securely connected to. This takes care of a very safe approach and unlimited scalability. We will dive deeper into the Twin’s security and scalability aspects in a future blog!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;digital-twin-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#digital-twin-in-a-nutshell&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: digital-twin-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Digital Twin in a nutshell&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, by now you will have a better understanding of the Digital Twin concept. Here is a short recap of everything mentioned so far about it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have full control over your own digital life.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiences can be created using standard web &amp;amp; native technologies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Digital Twin delivers the web interface to your (secure) browser.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need for information to travel to central data centers, all communication is fast and private between Digital Twins: No more client-server.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All logic of your digital life is 100% private to you running in your Twin.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is super efficient and sustainable, +10x power savings.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No blockchain required for your digital life = more privacy, performance, green
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exception: blockchain is needed for digital currencies and as a phone book for Digital Twin’s identity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/open-invitation-for-testing/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold technology, ecosystem and community have the potential to kickstart a new Internet era filled with abundance and opportunities for all. ThreeFold is 100% open-source, so anyone can contribute to ThreeFold on GitHub and build their own solutions and applications on ThreeFold’s infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now’s the time to start utilizing what we’ve built together and to start deploying the solutions and experiences we want to see in this world. Now’s the time to build better alternatives for people, enterprises and governments on top of this foundational infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invite you all to come in, see what’s possible, and start building – today!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-testing-so-crucial&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-is-testing-so-crucial&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-is-testing-so-crucial&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why is testing so crucial?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold created an open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure that offers a place for developers, end-users and everyone in-between to collectively build an open digital world with full digital sovereignty. We seek to re-imagine business, governance, finance, education and more to build a better future for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This future can only be achieved with the collaboration of a strong, healthy and dedicated community. One of the key challenges for a project like ours is the continuous testing and improving of new features as well as building all of the applications and solutions we’d like to see to enhance and grow the ecosystem. Community contributions are the heart and a crucial driver of the growing ThreeFold movement – a global movement that is open and decentralized, meaning it is up to each and everyone of us to push things forward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter your experience level, from developers to end-users and everyone in-between, there are options for you to contribute to ThreeFold. Whether you’re more tech-savvy and would like to develop solutions on top of the Grid and test tech features or rather help us improve the manuals and spread the word, there are many ways to take action and support the movement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable, open-source peer-to-peer infrastructure together with a growing community of enthusiastic, driven developers and end-users are the key to accelerating the growth and development of the Grid and to unlocking all of its potential. And the more people believe in ThreeFold and our Internet of Internets vision, the sooner we can bring digital sovereignty, empowerment and meaningful experiences to the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-you-join-threefold-s-tester-community&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why should you join ThreeFold’s tester community?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why get involved in ThreeFold? Well first of all, you can join an engaged, open movement that seeks to shape the future we want to live in and provide better solutions for our planet and people. You can meet, exchange and collaborate with people from all over the world that share similar interests and values.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also learn new skills and get to know some innovative technology that enables you to build and test pretty cool applications and solutions – like deploying a Subsquid instance on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or checking out the different decentralized alternatives to solutions we use every day like WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome or Zoom with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;demo.freeflow.life&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Our open, friendly and skilled community can offer you support and advice as you start testing and building. Let’s help each other and build cool stuff together!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-community-where-ideas-come-to-life&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Community – Where ideas come to life&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about what fellow community members are building on ThreeFold? Here are a few recent examples:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teisie has been working on a few great tools to make things easier for his fellow ThreeFolders like an iOS app for node monitoring and a geo explorer. Moreover, he’s been working on an uptime tool and deployment calculator – hosted on the Grid and using Drew’s gateway node for public access. Learn more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;teisies-uptime-tool-and-deployment-calculator&#x2F;3384?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Well done, Teisie!&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another skilled community member building on the Grid is Drew. With his &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;cockpit-managed-ubuntu-vm&#x2F;3376?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;community project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a Cockpit management interface, he provides a web-based interface for managing a VM that allows users to do a lot of maintenance tasks without ssh – even including full remote desktop capabilities from the browser. Pretty cool, right?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;

While &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, gives you a comprehensive overview of the Grid, its evolution and capabilities, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure-part-two&#x2F;&quot;&gt;second part&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is focused on the low-level building blocks and particularly interesting for the more tech-savvy crowd.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third and final part of our series on ThreeFold’s game-changing Internet infrastructure and the solutions available today. This time, we’ll show you what’s possible on the ThreeFold Playground today and how you can become one of the first testers of digitally sovereign end-user experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an incredible opportunity to become early adopters of our unique solutions, to get a taste of what it means to become digitally sovereign, and to help shape the future of the Internet. Together we build a decentralized digital world!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes it quite easy to build on top of the ThreeFold Grid by deploying weblets. A &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__weblets_home?id=weblets&quot;&gt;weblet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a compiled JavaScript component which can be embedded in any site. With ThreeFold, it basically establishes a private environment running inside your browser, and allows you to share it – while you maintain full control of all activities happening there by using your private key, and with full decentralization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the TF Playground, a variety of applications are made available and deployable within just a few clicks, all on top of a fully decentralized peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. From Virtual Machines to Kubernetes to Presearch Nodes, CapRover, ownCloud, and more – the playground allows you to build in a truly decentralized environment. Essentially, the Playground is an ever-expanding ecosystem of easily-deployable weblets that are built for a decentralized future. It’s the fastest way to build, test, and deploy and enables pretty much anyone to build and experiment with deployment on the Grid. So, this is huge!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Visit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the TF Playground to explore the possibilities and read this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-focus-series-tf-playground-v3-7-0&#x2F;3315?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to find out what the new version 3.7.0 of the Playground – now live on testnet – has to offer. Dive right in and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;getstarted&#x2F;manual__tfgrid3_getstarted&quot;&gt;get started&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the TF Grid today!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of the weblets available on the Playground:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: presearch&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Presearch&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presearch is a longstanding partner of ThreeFold and one of the most popular solutions offered on the Grid. As of the Grid v3.6 release, any 3Node can now host a Presearch node – so if you’re a ThreeFold farmer, it’s now become quite easy for you to host Presearch on your own node. Simply follow &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;presearch-nodes&#x2F;3250?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;this deployment guide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to get decentralized search on top of a truly decentralized infrastructure!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;caprover&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#caprover&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: caprover&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;CapRover&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;

You’ll benefit from full decentralization, energy efficiency and affordability. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;create-your-own-app-environment-fast-and-easy-with-caprover-on-the-people-s-internet&#x2F;2644?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;CapRover&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a powerful platform for app deployment and thanks to our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__weblets_caprover?id=caprover&quot;&gt;CapRover weblet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, you’re able to deploy anything you want on top of the ThreeFold Grid!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;new-subsquid-testnet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#new-subsquid-testnet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: new-subsquid-testnet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;NEW: Subsquid (testnet)&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;

Basically, you can think of Subsquid as an ETL (extract, transform, load) tool, with a GraphQL server included. With Grid v3.7.0 live on testnet, you can now pre-process and decode raw chain data and store it for easier access by the query nodes by deploying your own Subsquid instance on the Grid’s testnet within just a few clicks &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.test.grid.tf&#x2F;#&#x2F;subsquid&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the ThreeFold Playground, ThreeFold is building a vast ecosystem of advanced deployment experiences and opening up a world of possibilities – allowing anyone to build, test and deploy easily and within a few clicks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best thing about the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;getstarted&#x2F;manual__tfgrid3_getstarted&quot;&gt;playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;? It’s already been available for a while and continuously being improved and extended!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Through simple, secure, and scalable technology, ThreeFold empowers millions to invent and explore new experiences.“ – &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;paradise-hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kristof de Spiegeleer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve entered the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four-phases-of-threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;third phase of our journey&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; towards our ultimate vision of a better future – the phase of Web 4. In addition to fully comprehensive decentralized edge cloud solutions, the ThreeFold ecosystem is also developing a range of applications and experiences across IoT, metaverse, blockchain, DeFi, banking, education and beyond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout this phase – which has only just begun – a multitude of valuable and meaningful experiences are being built by the ThreeFold ecosystem and partners to empower people with equal chances to learn, create, and thrive in a decentralized digital economy – what we like to call an abundance-based future for humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first roll-out of the third phase will empower people to become fully self-sovereign thanks to ThreeFold’s Digital Twin technology and a variety of decentralized alternatives to popular applications and tools. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;freeflow-twin&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#freeflow-twin&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: freeflow-twin&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Digital Twin technology provides each user with a unique digital identity that can serve as the key to an open, self-sovereign and complete digital future. This solution was designed with a very simple objective in mind: everyone should be the center of their entire digital life. It represents your digital self and hosts your entire digital life in a secure and private way – empowering you to own your data and offering you decentralized applications that enable you to maintain your sovereignty. For end users, owning their own deployments opens the possibility for a full range of experiences that have the same quality as crypto – self custody.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Grid V3.7.0, ThreeFold’s all-in-one decentralized productivity tool that includes instant messaging, video call, social, and data storage features – formerly known as Uhuru – is being rebranded to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru&#x2F;3299?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It brings sovereign and secure alternatives to many of the centralized solutions we use every day like Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome, Zoom and many more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-updates-august-2022&#x2F;3272?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be part of an ecosystem of decentralized alternatives called FreeFlow Life. Find more information on the experiences, how to start testing now and where to share your feedback &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru&#x2F;3299?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paradigm shift is a pretty big deal, isn’t it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s open Internet infrastructure is fully peer-to-peer, decentralized and super reliable. It already offers a multitude of solutions for developers, end-users and everyone in-between. And the Grid and the solutions offered are ready for the community to build, deploy and test, as we continue to collectively build, advance and expand.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we’ve collectively already built a lot and achieved crucial milestones towards realizing our ultimate goals, we’re also just the beginning of the third phase of our exciting journey with many ambitions and goals still ahead.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re still in a spot where we can be considered a hidden gem and being way undervalued, remember this: ThreeFold is inevitable. We are visionaries, building the plane in the air. We are confident in growing the project in a real and authentic way. We have a strong plan and vision. Our technology is needed. The underlying foundation is functional and ready. Now, it’s up to the believers to build, test and deploy the solutions we need for a better world. And together, we build. Together, we can achieve the extraordinary and provide better alternatives for people, enterprises and governments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s reliable, open-source, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure together with a growing community of enthusiastic, driven early-adopter developers and end-users are the key to accelerating the growth and development of the Grid and to unlocking all of its potential. While the foundation has been laid, it will be up to all of us as a movement to improve and build upon it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking back at the ThreeFold Grid’s evolution and what makes it a game-changing Internet infrastructure in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part one&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it’s time to explore our cloud solution and the technology available today in part two! You can think of these as some of the essential low-level building blocks that when combined created a limitless sandbox for developers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering what virtual machines are, haven’t heard about Kubernetes before and don’t know your way around coding languages, this part might be less interesting for you. Feel free to skip and jump right into &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;build-on-threefolds-open-infrastructure-part-three&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part three&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on weblets and end-user experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: elements-of-our-comprehensive-decentralized-cloud-solution&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Elements of our comprehensive &amp;amp; decentralized cloud solution&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid provides &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_primitives&quot;&gt;various primitives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for compute, storage, and network – fulfilling all the needs centralized cloud providers cater to as well, while offering advantages in terms of decentralization, energy efficiency, security and more. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; includes a collection of components, called primitives. These primitives are the low-level constructs which can be deployed on the ThreeFold Grid. As mentioned above, they act as building blocks for skilled developers that enable them to build and create in complete digital freedom.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the high compatibility of ThreeFold’s primitives with industry-standard tools and protocols makes it easy and seamless for developers to migrate workloads to the Grid. All of the primitives not only benefit from the unique efficiency and security features of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, but also come with unique features and capabilities themselves. Here are some of the primitives to give you an idea of what you’ll get:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;zmachine&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zmachine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zmachine&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ZMachine&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;zmachine?id=zmachine&quot;&gt;ZMachine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a lightweight virtual machine (VM) solution that’s unique to the ThreeFold Grid. ZMachine enables both traditional VM deployments and also introduces a next generation container specification built on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos_fs?id=why-this-zflist-concept&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; technology. ZFlist containers enabled by ZMachines are more secure and more flexible than the current industry standard Docker-based containers. With Kubernetes running on top of ThreeFold’s ZMachine &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__grid_use?id=tfgrid-kubernetes-cloud&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we have a highly compatible and unique solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;zflist&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zflist&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zflist&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos_fs?id=why-this-zflist-concept&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a next generation container format – supported directly at the operating system level on Zero-OS – which extends the industry-standard Docker container concept in an efficient and secure way. It provides a unique advantage over traditional containers via the use of mini VMs. By employing mini VMs, the FList concept provides better isolation than traditional container systems while retaining the advantages that containers offer over full VMs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;kubernetes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#kubernetes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: kubernetes&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold has long supported the most used open-source container orchestration tool in the world, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kubernetes.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which integrates the industry standard &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.docker.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; format, a container creation and management tool. It’s used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments. Kubernetes can be used to create a production-ready environment. The ThreeFold Grid provides a lightweight Kubernetes VM that can be used to create clusters according to specific needs. By providing both VMs and Kubernetes, we’re able to offer the most comprehensive solution in the decentralized&#x2F;blockchain space to deploy, scale, and manage cloud compute workloads. Kubernetes users can, for the most part, simply bring their existing configuration files and recreate their deployments on a Grid based cluster seamlessly. With the third generation of the Grid, we provided a very simple way to provision &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual3_iac&#x2F;grid3_terraform&#x2F;manual__terraform_k8s?id=more-info&quot;&gt;Kubernetes clusters with Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;terraform&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#terraform&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: terraform&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-grid-3-0-supports-terraform&#x2F;1184?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a widely-used open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) software tool enabling a consistent workflow in order to manage complex deployments across different cloud providers. It also integrates directly with our Grid’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;threefold__usp_compatible?id=kubernetes&quot;&gt;existing Kubernetes functionality&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to offer a complete solution for reserving hardware and deploying software.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Terraform offers a complete solution for reserving hardware and deploying software. It allows for specifying deployments on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_home&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a simple, declarative, and human-readable language describing the desired end state. Terraform can be used to deploy the full set of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; primitives, supporting any existing or future Linux workload, with endless possibilities. It is like a lower-level Kubernetes for the hardware part of cloud deployments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;dedicated-nodes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#dedicated-nodes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: dedicated-nodes&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Dedicated Nodes&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;

By utilizing dedicated nodes on the ThreeFold Grid, you’ll benefit from a truly decentralized and highly reliable Internet infrastructure that uses less energy and comes at a much more affordable price than any comparable alternative. With dedicated nodes, users are able to exclusively reserve the entire capacity of a 3Node to deploy solutions for themselves or for other customers, while also paying for all capacity of the respective 3Node. Dedicated nodes on our Grid will be highly cost effective, as they’ll be available with a 70% discount on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;pricing-for-tfgrid&#x2F;2518&#x2F;7&quot;&gt;pricing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All the ThreeFold Grid features will be available on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;exciting-news-dedicated-nodes-on-the-people-s-internet&#x2F;2645?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;dedicated nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as well – from deploying VMs and containers to CapRover and more. Dedicated and non-dedicated 3Nodes can be combined.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;v-language&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#v-language&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: v-language&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;V Language&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is built with simplicity in mind which is why we’re using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;partners&#x2F;vlang&#x2F;&quot;&gt;V&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – a statically typed programming language similar to Go, and inspired by Rust, Swift, and Oberon. It’s the official &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__smartcontract_it&quot;&gt;smart contract&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; language on the Grid, as its simplicity and readability allows anyone to go through and understand any code base, even non-developers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being simple, V gives a lot of power to the developer and can be used in pretty much every field, including systems programming, webdev, gamedev, GUI, mobile, science, embedded, tooling, etc. It aims to become an alternative to JavaScript as the de facto coding language on the market in the upcoming years. With V, the developer doesn’t need to change anything in their code. “It just works”, like in Python, Go, or Java, except there’s no heavy GC tracing everything or expensive RC for each object. V can translate your entire C project and offer you the safety, simplicity, and 10-25x faster compilation speeds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With +30,5K Stars on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;vlang&#x2F;v&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, V brings a strong open-source developer community to the ThreeFold ecosystem to develop the infrastructures and applications of tomorrow – making it the ideal smart contract language for the ThreeFold ecosystem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What started out as an idea for a better Internet about a decade ago amongst a few early Internet and Cloud pioneers has now become a reality. Today, ThreeFold is a global movement building a reliable, open and inclusive Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Internet. And ThreeFold is ready to unlock a new Internet era – one filled with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet-first-people-first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;abundance and opportunity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for all, one which is better for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planting-the-seeds&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our planet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Our open-source technology, future-facing ecosystem and collaborative community have the potential to drive this new era forward.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us, the Internet was always meant to be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;p2p-web3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, where anyone could own hardware, and connect and exchange directly with full security and in full privacy – without any entity in the middle. This is how the Internet began. But as demand grew, big tech began to monopolize its infrastructure and all the major platforms.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, ThreeFold has been committed not only to delivering on the original promise of the Internet, but also to realizing our ultimate vision of a better future for all. For the past six years, we’ve been building up an incredible full-stack, open-source, decentralized Internet, all &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-threefold-is-building-a-new-internet-from-the-ground-up&#x2F;2057?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;from the ground-up&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We’ve come a long way and the result is, well, exceptional. There is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; else out there like ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From creating our own blockchain-driven and highly secure &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;operating system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (which allows computers to become decentralized servers), to building an ultra-scalable &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;qsss&#x2F;threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe Storage System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a complete far &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-at-the-edge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;edge cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; computing platform and a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;planetary peer-to-peer network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; all accessible via a unique Smart Contract for IT on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf-chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we’re proud to have the most &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-at-the-edge&#x2F;&quot;&gt;complete edge infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to power the next-generation Internet era.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we’re taking concrete steps to further expand this infrastructure that offers a truly decentralized layer 0 for any blockchain or Internet application. Moreover, with the help of our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldtesting&quot;&gt;community of Grid testers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we’re continuously advancing the underlying technology and working towards making it usable for as many people and use cases as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vision and technology have matured into the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet-of-internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – a network of thousands of community-built and -owned Internets through which we strive to interconnect all of humanity. A new world is coming, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__technology&quot;&gt;our technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has the potential to revolutionize digitization on a global scale, across sectors. And yet we remain a hidden gem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what solutions does the ThreeFold Grid offer today already? And why exactly should you start to build on top of ThreeFold? Let’s explore some of the many possibilities available today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-grid-a-cutting-edge-highly-scalable-peer-to-peer-infrastructure&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Grid – A cutting-edge, highly scalable peer-to-peer infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“ThreeFold is growing the ThreeFold Grid by enabling a community of thousands of farmers from around the world to participate and own a piece of the Internet.” – &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;threefold_cybernews&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Adnan Fatayerji&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Grid is a peer-to-peer cloud computing network that’s highly compatible with current industry standards. In late December 2021, ThreeFold launched the third generation of the ThreeFold Grid on mainnet with a fully functional tech stack – a huge and crucial step towards a fully production-ready and decentralized infrastructure. The third generation not only brought a massive leap forward in the decentralization of the Grid but also made for a much simpler user experience for farmers and Grid users. People from all over the world are connecting thousands of 3Nodes to create the world’s largest decentralized Internet infrastructure, and new capacity is being connected every day. Find the latest Grid stats and utilization numbers in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;grid-stats-new-nodes-overview&#x2F;3291?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;this regularly updated thread&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold-2022-reflect-h1-outlook-h2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Over the past months&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the team evolved the Grid through version 3.6.1 and upgraded it to mainnet in July after receiving 100% community approval. This &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tfgrid-product-updates-july-2022-tfgrid-v3-6-1-highlights-and-more&#x2F;3206&#x2F;2?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;release&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; introduces more stability to the TF Grid and includes various upgrades and new features like the ThreeFold Connect App, the new unified dashboard for a simpler user experience, and more. Big progress was also made in terms of the DAO functionality that went live on TF Chain, with the first TF Chain (L1) DAO proposal was voted on and approved in August.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with each new Grid release, we’re getting one step closer to solidifying the foundation of the Internet of Internets. Currently, the team is working towards completing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-updates-august-2022&#x2F;3272?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Grid version 3.7.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which includes some significant updates, improvements and new features like FreeFlow Twin, a new Node Pilot, new deployment features and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-updates-august-2022&#x2F;3272?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;a lot more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The team continues to do incredible work to further develop and advance the Grid as well as to support utilization and adoption by offering tools and applications that are user-friendly, secure, efficient and scalable. A massive thank you to our incredible tech team and the community of Grid testers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we previously shared, we believe in the organic and sustainable growth of ThreeFold Token and the Internet of Internets vision. And one of our key goals is to strengthen the foundation of the ecosystem by enhancing the stability and liquidity of the ThreeFold Token (TFT). So today, we’re embarking on a little journey to find out how to access TFT and how to provide liquidity on Stellar via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;albedo.link&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Albedo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-are-liquidity-pools&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-liquidity-pools&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-are-liquidity-pools&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What are liquidity pools?&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity pools are an integral part of DeFi systems and can be understood as a “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blockchain-council.org&#x2F;defi&#x2F;crypto-liquidity-pools&#x2F;&quot;&gt;collection of tokens or digital assets stored in a smart contract&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” on a decentralized exchange (DEX). Liquidity pools allow users to buy or sell such assets in a decentralized way and are used to enhance decentralized trading, lending&#x2F;borrowing and other DeFi services. Users get rewarded with a cut of the fees generated in the process to incentivize them to become liquidity providers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-does-it-mean-to-drive-liquidity-on-stellar&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-it-mean-to-drive-liquidity-on-stellar&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-it-mean-to-drive-liquidity-on-stellar&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What does it mean to drive liquidity on Stellar?&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar offers multiple great solutions and basically everything we need, so it’s crucial for us to start building our own liquidity there. Since every asset and currency starts with zero liquidity when issued on Stellar, it is up to the community to put capital onto the Stellar Network and to put that capital to use for trading, e.g. by adding liquidity to pools with TFT. The more liquidity we provide on Stellar, the more we contribute to creating and sustaining a healthy market for TFT there – while simultaneously attracting others to get involved in TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Find out all about Stellar, its role for the TFT ecosystem, how to buy TFT on Stellar, and more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thriving_with_stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;about-albedo&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-albedo&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-albedo&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About Albedo &lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;albedo.link&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Albedo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; acts as a single access point to the Stellar ecosystem. It’s a free, open-source, secure and simple browser wallet for the Stellar Network. Albedo allows other Stellar apps to request transaction signing or identity verification – without ever requiring the exposure of users’ secret keys. It’s a nice and simple browser-based keystore with wallet-, swap- and liquidity pool functionalities. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we will now go through the process of accessing TFT and providing liquidity on Stellar by using Albedo and its key features. All it takes are four simple steps:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up Albedo&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get TFT&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose another asset&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add liquidity to a pool&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1-set-up-albedo&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-1-set-up-albedo&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-1-set-up-albedo&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 1 – Set up Albedo&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albedo is not just a wallet. It’s a &lt;strong&gt;keystore&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; that interconnects applications across the Stellar universe and signs a transaction or verifies your identity for you, without running the risk of exposing your secret key or having to create new accounts for every Stellar application. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-1-open-albedo&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-1-1-open-albedo&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-1-1-open-albedo&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 1.1: Open Albedo&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albedo works as a &lt;strong&gt;web app and browser extension&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, meaning you can either access it in your browser or install the extension on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;kbojmmmibkfijmjgnfgfpngmmgkkpncl&quot;&gt;Chrome&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;albedo-signer-for-stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Once you’ve either opened Albedo in your browser or installed the extension, just follow the instructions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this step-by-step guide, I’ve chosen to open Albedo in my browser instead of using the extension.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-2-set-up-your-albedo-account&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-1-2-set-up-your-albedo-account&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-1-2-set-up-your-albedo-account&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 1.2: Set up your Albedo account&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, click on the “Create Albedo account”-button. Next, click “Proceed” on the bottom of the Welcome page.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can choose between between three main options:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import account&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create account&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have an Albedo account, either directly &lt;strong&gt;log in&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; or – if it’s the first time you’re using Albedo on a new device – click on the “Import Account”-button to &lt;strong&gt;import the 24 word passphrase or secret key&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and access your account.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;import_wallet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Import Wallet&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to Albedo, you’ll need to create an Albedo account first in order to use the keystore. Choose a &lt;strong&gt;safe password&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for this account and hit “Create account”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;set_account_password.png&quot; alt=&quot;Set Account Password&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just set up your Albedo account! Make sure to carefully read the instructions on keeping your &lt;strong&gt;recovery phrase&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; safe, before continuing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;recovery_phrase.png&quot; alt=&quot;Recovery Phrase&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can check out your new account and play around with the settings, e.g. to change your account’s name. You also get an overview of all the possible ways to use Albedo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;albedo_overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Albedo Overview&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-1-3-activate-account-on-ledger&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-1-3-activate-account-on-ledger&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-1-3-activate-account-on-ledger&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 1.3: Activate account on ledger&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make your Albedo account fully functional, you’ll need to initially activate the account on the ledger by sending at least &lt;strong&gt;1.6 XLM&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to your account’s address. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2-get-tft&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-2-get-tft&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-2-get-tft&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 2 – Get TFT&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come to fund your Albedo account with TFT. Simply swap other assets for TFT if you’re already holding some in your Albedo account or transfer TFT from other wallets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good to know: Albedo doesn’t provide a direct fiat gateway. Visit our TFT knowledge base to discover all the ways you can &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy?id=how-to-buy-amp-sell-tft&quot;&gt;buy TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, including fiat options.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-2-a-deposit-tft-to-your-albedo-account&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-2-2-a-deposit-tft-to-your-albedo-account&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-2-2-a-deposit-tft-to-your-albedo-account&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 2.2.A: Deposit TFT to your Albedo account&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re holding TFT in a different wallet, simply transfer the tokens and send them to your Albedo account. Simply open your wallet and send TFT to your Albedo address. It’s best to copy your Albedo address which is displayed in the top-left corner by clicking on the copy-symbol – it’s not only faster but also safer as copying prevents you from making typos.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;copy_wallet_address.png&quot; alt=&quot;Copy Wallet Address&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-2-b-swap-xlm-usdc-for-tft-within-albedo&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-2-2-b-swap-xlm-usdc-for-tft-within-albedo&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-2-2-b-swap-xlm-usdc-for-tft-within-albedo&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 2.2.B: Swap XLM&#x2F;USDC for TFT within Albedo&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also stay within Albedo by buying XLM or USDC first and then swapping them for TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;swap_for_tft.png&quot; alt=&quot;Swap for TFT&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: I recommend buying XLM regardless of whether you’re choosing option A or B, as you’re going to &lt;strong&gt;need XLM to pay for the transaction fees&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; within the Stellar Network anyways.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-2-3-activate-assets&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-2-3-activate-assets&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-2-3-activate-assets&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 2.3: Activate assets&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that you have to add a trustline for any asset you want to store in your Albedo account in order to activate it. Just go to “Balance” in your account overview. On the bottom of the page, you’ll find the “Add trustline”-button.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;activate_assets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Activate Assets&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on “Add trustline”, then press the “Choose an asset” on the next page and type TFT into the “Select an asset”-field.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;choose_asset_trustline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Choose Asset Trustline&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caution: make sure to select the right TFT&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; – the one with our logo that’s linked with our website threefold.io – as shown in the image below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;select_asset_trustline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select Asset Trustline&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can activate the selected asset by pressing “Add trustline”.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;add_trustline.png&quot; alt=&quot;Add Trustline&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3-choose-another-asset&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-3-choose-another-asset&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-3-choose-another-asset&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 3 – Choose another asset&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you already have TFT in your Albedo account, so it’s time to choose a second asset to combine with TFT as a trading pair like XLM or USDC. You can get XLM or USDC on many exchanges and then deposit it to your Albedo wallet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeat the same procedure of buying&#x2F;depositing&#x2F;swapping and activating for this second asset – the other part of the trading pair you’ve chosen to provide liquidity to in a pool. We chose USDC.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4-add-liquidity-to-a-pool&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-4-add-liquidity-to-a-pool&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-4-add-liquidity-to-a-pool&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 4 – Add liquidity to a pool&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this guide, we’ll be depositing TFT and USDC in order to provide liquidity to the pool. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after creating and activating your account and assets on Albedo, you’re now holding TFT and USDC. You’re ready to add liquidity to the TFT &amp;lt;&amp;gt; USDC pool on Albedo.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-1-select-assets-amount&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-4-1-select-assets-amount&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-4-1-select-assets-amount&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 4.1: Select assets &amp;amp; amount&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head to the “Liquidity” section in order to select the two assets you’d like to provide liquidity to and to set the amount of TFT and USDC you would like to provide to this pool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;select_assets_and_amount.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select Assets and Amount&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-4-2-deposit-liquidity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#step-4-2-deposit-liquidity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: step-4-2-deposit-liquidity&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Step 4.2: Deposit liquidity&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re ready to provide liquidity! Click on the “Deposit liquidity to the pool”-button located at the bottom of your screen to add the selected assets to the pool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;deposit_liquidity_to_pool.png&quot; alt=&quot;Deposit Liquidity to Pool&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congrats, you’ve just added liquidity to the TFT &amp;lt;&amp;gt; USDC pool!&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you’re a liquidity provider on Stellar! Other ways to contribute to Stellar’s liquidity pools are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xbull.app&#x2F;&quot;&gt;xBull Wallet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellarx.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;StellarX&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. No matter which of the interfaces you use, they all enable you to add liquidity to the same underlying pool on the &lt;strong&gt;StellarDEX&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the trading pair you chose.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As exciting as this is, please don’t forget: With great decentralization comes great responsibility! So, do your own research on how liquidity pools work and make sure you understand the risks related to impermanent loss. Also, read &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__threefold_wallets?id=important-notes&quot;&gt;this advice&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on keeping your TFT safe.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, the blockchain space is flooded with as many as 22,000 coins and tokens and for several months now, the market has been struggling at large with some coins even collapsing. A thorough shakeout could expose those tokens and coins purely focused on making quick profits and creating hype, and mitigate pump-and-dump schemes. Now’s the time for projects like us to shine – projects with tokens that serve a higher purpose and come with sound tokenomics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tft-an-accessible-utility-token&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tft-an-accessible-utility-token&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tft-an-accessible-utility-token&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;TFT – An Accessible Utility Token&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re an Internet infrastructure project building the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; together with a growing community around the world. So, TFT is not just any token. TFT is our native utility token, and as such, is backed by the continuous growth of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__newtotokens?id=threefold-token-for-beginners&quot;&gt;utility tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are created to give digital access to specific products or services. While they do provide value in different ways, they cannot be considered “money” as directly as coins can be.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the utility token and medium of exchange of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__grid_intro&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, TFT represents Internet capacity. It supports a truly decentralized Internet for all and is leveraged to access and scale our open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. TFT is and will remain our main token, it’s our global currency. In a nutshell, TFT is our way of incentivizing an open ecosystem where anyone can connect and utilize Internet capacity without any intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve made a lot of progress in making the ThreeFold Token more accessible and in creating a healthy financial ecosystem for it. Moreover, the team is building our own DeFi solutions. You can learn more about our efforts towards providing a native financial system for the Internet of Internets &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;future_tft_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re new to ThreeFold, I recommend giving our “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__newtotokens&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token for Beginners&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” page a read.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;limited-supply-and-strong-scarcity-mechanisms&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#limited-supply-and-strong-scarcity-mechanisms&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: limited-supply-and-strong-scarcity-mechanisms&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Limited Supply and Strong Scarcity Mechanisms&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the supply of TFT is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_limited_supply&quot;&gt;limited&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to a total number of 4 billion. New TFT are only minted when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid – we call this process of connecting capacity &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro&quot;&gt;farming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The tokens are minted using our so-called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_capacity&quot;&gt;Proof of Capacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; algorithm. We’re also exploring the possibility of providing farmers with booster rewards for certain achievements in areas like reliability and uptime, quality of bandwidth, level of utilization. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet_first_people_first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;planet-first people-first philosophy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we’ve implemented a Voluntary Carbon Credits system in the PoC algorithm, so every 3Node mints additional TFT to offset its own carbon emissions, as outlined &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive&#x2F;2097?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To incentivize the long-term growth of the ecosystem, a burning mechanism permanently removes TFT from the circulating supply, as this ensures scarcity and continuous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;farming rewards&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Burning will increase proportionally as the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_utilization&quot;&gt;utilization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Grid grows, ensuring the amount of TFT in the market is limited and leading to a healthy economic system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, many existing token holders expressed their confidence and support by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__vesting_overview&quot;&gt;vesting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; their TFT in 2021, further limiting the number of TFT circulating. Moreover, chances are that a growing number of token owners will hold onto their TFT – because they expect the token to rise in value – which will increase scarcity. Ultimately, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__threefold_token&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has the potential to become a valuable commodity, offering a more reliable alternative to other digital currencies like Bitcoin. The hoarding of TFT means that these tokens won’t be available to be used on the Grid, additionally reducing the amount of available TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are more factors potentially reinforcing scarcity. Staking is the mechanism to let the community invest and benefit from the growth of the Grid. Once the validator nodes can be deployed, validator owners and community members will be able to stake TFT on the validators which will secure the blockchain. To unlock voting rights and rewards, a certain amount of TFT has to be staked. Eventually, rewards for the validator owners could account for up to 50% of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__threefold_token&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; supply.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of the token’s scarcity mechanisms with our staking and validator programs will lead to an increased scarcity of TFT on the market – which, in turn, will allow our future DeFi solutions to sell TFT at a higher value. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t believe in hype or speculation, and we don’t spend any of our scarce resources on supporting speculation. We believe in the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which will interconnect us all, while providing us with digital sovereignty, privacy and meaningful experiences. We believe in the organic and sustainable growth of ThreeFold Token and the Internet of Internets vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with building community-owned Internets, our ecosystem is reimagining education, business, governance and more for a fair, inclusive and regenerative future – opening up a new world of possibilities. And in order to connect such an ecosystem of Internets, a healthy and fair financial system with a strong, stable currency is key.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the glocal concept will be rolled out, the ThreeFold Token will unfold its &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-real-value-of-tft&#x2F;3143&quot;&gt;potential&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and flourish. The Internet of Internets empowers people to build their own regional Internet infrastructures and will become a huge stimulator for the TFT economy. Every Regional Internet will have its own self-sustaining liquidity pool, validators, and regional digital currencies – with TFT acting as the reserve currency of the entire decentralized system. It is the currency needed to transfer between all the different Regional Internets via liquidity pools. TFT is also the currency of the main ThreeFold Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is not only for believers in open source and decentralization. ThreeFold, and TFT, are needed. TFT is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-real-value-of-tft&#x2F;3143&quot;&gt;much more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; than a simple token. It energizes the ThreeFold Grid and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expansion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of a truly decentralized Internet. There are many new ecosystem developments, tech advancements and building blocks for the Internet of Internets happening all around.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The realization of the Internet of Internets combined with the previously mentioned burning and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_limited_supply&quot;&gt;scarcity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; mechanisms will trigger basic supply-and-demand mechanisms. The limited token supply will meet a rising demand for TFT. The token will be needed to buy and reserve current or future Internet capacity and services on our Grid as well as for driving the rollout and expansion of the Internet of Internets – establishing the global Internets of Internets alone will require billions of TFT. In addition to that, TFT will be needed to access the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;lets-test-out-freeflow-twin-beta-formerly-uhuru&#x2F;3299&#x2F;12&quot;&gt;FreeFlow Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (formerly known as Uhuru) and to deploy workloads on the Grid, e.g. through weblets on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-product-focus-series-tf-playground-v3-7-0&#x2F;3315&#x2F;3&quot;&gt;TF Playground&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. All in all, there will be a natural economic demand for TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>A Glimpse into the Future of the TFT Ecosystem</title>
		<published>2022-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/future-tft-ecosystem/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The emergence of blockchain technology presented the world with new exciting opportunities – from independent digital currencies and decentralized financial (DeFi) applications to smart contracts, consensus-driven voting systems, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Above all, blockchain technology held, and still holds, the promise of decentralization and transparency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somewhere along the way, much of the blockchain and crypto space started to return to principles and methods of the old financial system. Many projects out there seem to choose hype and fast profits over long-term growth and providing real value. Now, unsurprisingly, we’re experiencing a serious bear market, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022-bear-market-has-been-the-worst-on-record-glassnode&quot;&gt;the worst&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; crypto has seen to date.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t have to be a bad thing, though. And it won’t be, for projects like us who provide real value, bring impactful solutions, and take a different approach. The monetary system is clearly failing, we shouldn’t need to rely on central banks – or even centralized exchanges for that matter. And we don’t have to!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in decentralization. And we believe that the future is decentralized. DeFi is great and fortunately, many decentralized alternatives already exist, with thriving ecosystems and communities. There are many options to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy&quot;&gt;buy and sell TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in a decentralized way, including multiple options within the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thriving_with_stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stellar ecosystem&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – and we’re also exploring meaningful partnership opportunities with Algorand. Both Stellar and Algorand already provide everything we need for a healthy financial ecosystem and offer various functions crucial for the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ecosystem – from order books to wallets to AMM liquidity pools and on&#x2F;off ramp options. And both have huge, thriving communities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these great decentralized options, we’ve decided to develop our own DeFi solutions to support the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;growth and expansion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Internet of Internets and an abundance-based future where we are truly sovereign: community-based liquidity pools and the P2P DeFi Wallet. These DeFi solutions will be the foundation of the financial system for the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at both of the innovative features and when to expect them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-threefold-liquidity-pools&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-threefold-liquidity-pools&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-are-threefold-liquidity-pools&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What are ThreeFold Liquidity Pools?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s community-based liquidity pools are a means of enabling the people and organizations within the ThreeFold ecosystem to exchange &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and to provide liquidity in a safe and decentralized way. They will become the main point of entry and exit for TFT. And everyone can be a part of this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-p2p-defi-wallet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-the-p2p-defi-wallet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-the-p2p-defi-wallet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is the P2P DeFi Wallet?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name P2P DeFi Wallet already gives away, this new wallet is a DeFi platform based on peer-to-peer principles. It will enable anyone to buy and sell TFT, and to trade it for other digital currencies in a highly secure and safe way within the wallet – no need to integrate with other DeFi applications or exchanges. This prevents TFT from market manipulation and protects our community from abuse by financial bots. This wallet provides a solid, stable financial base for our token.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-are-these-new-defi-solutions-important-for-the-threefold-ecosystem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-are-these-new-defi-solutions-important-for-the-threefold-ecosystem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-are-these-new-defi-solutions-important-for-the-threefold-ecosystem&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why Are These New DeFi Solutions Important for the ThreeFold Ecosystem?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain ecosystems like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;thriving_with_stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and Algorand are amazing and offer everything we need to organically grow the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. And yet, we need additional mechanisms for liquidity providing which are designed to support the Internet of Internets. Many AMM DeFi pools are great and a step forward but not sufficient for certain use cases, e.g. DeFi pools usually don’t support bigger exchange trades, as the price would be too affected. Classic order book trading on-chain comes with its own set of limitations as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with building community-owned Internets, our ecosystem is reimagining education, business, governance and more for a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet_first_people_first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;fair, inclusive and regenerative future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – opening up a new world of possibilities. And in order to connect such an ecosystem of Internets, a healthy and fair financial system is key.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity pools and our P2P DeFi Wallet will work together. They are designed to improve the stability and liquidity of TFT, and will allow us to acquire as many tokens as possible from external sources. Buying back as many TFT as possible will not only lead to the rise and stabilization of the value of TFT – it will also allow us to build a protected treasury that supports our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;co-owned future&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as the TFT in the pools will be used to provide the community with liquidity as we grow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidity pools and the new wallet are key to building our own liquid, peer-to-peer financial system based on Web 4 principles – powering a new economic model and offering a fair, equally accessible and decentralized financial system for the Internet of Internets. Additionally, the liquidity coming from the pools and the wallet will enable us to accelerate the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expansion and Web 4 phases&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of our journey towards building the future we want to live in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of TFT’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796&quot;&gt;scarcity mechanisms&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with our staking and validator programmes, will lead to an increased scarcity of TFT on the market – which, in turn, will allow the liquidity pools and wallet to sell TFT at a higher value.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future-of-the-tft-ecosystem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-future-of-the-tft-ecosystem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-future-of-the-tft-ecosystem&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Future of the TFT Ecosystem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in the organic growth of our token and the Internet of Internets vision. So, building our own sustainable, peer-to-peer DeFi system will mark a new chapter for the ThreeFold movement. And the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; concept will become a huge stimulator for the TFT economy, as every Regional Internet will have its own self-sustaining liquidity pool, validators, and regional TFTs – with TFT acting as the reserve currency of the entire decentralized system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing our own DeFi solutions for the Internet of Internets will complement the opportunities of ecosystems like Stellar and Algorand, and enrich the TFT ecosystem. The community-based liquidity pools and P2P wallet are another major step in bringing a fair financial model that will create more opportunities and empower people from all over the world to co-create a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;planet_first_people_first&#x2F;&quot;&gt;better system for all&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited for these new solutions which are expected by early next year. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;Join the movement&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to stay updated on the TFT ecosystem! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2014, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open network for storing, moving and trading any kind of money transparently and efficiently. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;learn&#x2F;intro-to-stellar&quot;&gt;decentralized system&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; enables users “to create, send, and trade digital representations of all forms of money” in a faster, cheaper and more energy-efficient way – facilitating millions of transactions on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;stellar&#x2F;&quot;&gt;2020&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold decided to move the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__token_what&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) to Stellar from Rivine (a transactional blockchain created by ThreeFold), which still is the main blockchain for the minting of TFT and the distribution of farming rewards. Internet capacity provisioning and workload deployments are executed via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Therefore, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bridges_connecting_threefold_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bridges&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between Stellar and TF Chain were established to facilitate payments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn more about the blockchains TFT is available on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bridges_connecting_threefold_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-we-chose-stellar-what-the-network-offers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-we-chose-stellar-what-the-network-offers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-we-chose-stellar-what-the-network-offers&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why we chose Stellar &amp;amp; What the Network offers&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were and still are big fans of Stellar. Over the last two years, we’ve had a great experience with Stellar. And we believe everything we need for a healthy financial ecosystem is already available on Stellar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stellar Network is faster, more cost-effective and more energy-efficient than usual blockchain-based systems. It’s a huge, highly reliable network that integrates a multitude of digital currencies and provides good liquidity. In addition to that, we share the same values and a similar vision: Stellar and ThreeFold are both open source, looking to empower humanity and striving towards building fair, inclusive systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar has a lot to offer, including:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;on-off-ramps&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#on-off-ramps&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: on-off-ramps&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;On&#x2F;Off Ramps&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar helps exchanges with enabling compliant &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resources.stellar.org&#x2F;stellar-for-exchanges&quot;&gt;on&#x2F;off ramps&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and thereby opens up exchanges’ access to new markets, users and services&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar does so through native and interoperable on&#x2F;off-ramps within the Stellar Network, called anchors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All exchanges have to do is integrate assets like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;usdc&quot;&gt;Stellar USDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;order-books&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#order-books&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: order-books&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Order Books&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar has a built-in decentralized exchange, SDEX, which enables users to place orders to buy or sell one Stellar-network asset for another&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These orders are aggregated into so-called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stellar.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-automated-market-makers-on-stellar&quot;&gt;order books&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and prioritized for execution based on price&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order book model is very established – it’s the same model used by traditional exchanges where users trade forex or cryptocurrencies&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, order books on decentralized money chains are pretty straightforward, while basically offering the same functionalities as centralized exchanges&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The order book on Stellar is relatively small but as people start using it it will get bigger, there is no downside compared to Liquid&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TFT is also available on order books on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;usdc&quot;&gt;Stellar USDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;automated-market-makers-amms&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#automated-market-makers-amms&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: automated-market-makers-amms&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Automated Market Makers (AMMs)&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;developers-blog&#x2F;protocol-18-upgrade-complete&quot;&gt;November 2021&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, Stellar natively supports the creation of AMMs to improve liquidity and to thereby make cross-border payments fast, cheap, and highly usable&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMMs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stellar.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-automated-market-makers-on-stellar&quot;&gt;coexist alongside&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the SDEX as an alternate source of liquidity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They democratize access by making the process of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stellar.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;amms-in-the-stellar-ecosystem&quot;&gt;providing liquidity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; accessible, simple, and inclusive while making asset conversion more efficient&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While users trade against other users’ existing orders in the order book model, users trade against a liquidity pool with AMMs&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMMs on Stellar are a great opportunity to provide easily accessible liquidity at scale, especially for markets that are new and&#x2F;or overlooked by traditional market makers, as issuers of an asset on Stellar don’t have to rely on market makers anymore – with AMMs, they can set up liquidity pools and enable individuals to provide liquidity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small fees incur when trading against a liquidity pool to incentivize liquidity providers&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;wallets&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#wallets&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: wallets&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Wallets &lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar provides a number of different &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;ecosystem&#x2F;projects?tab=wallets#Wallets&quot;&gt;wallets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with various functionalities, both hardware and software wallets, to make it really simple for users to enter the Stellar Network – from LOBSTR and Solar to StellarX and Trezor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see, Stellar offers multiple great solutions and basically everything we need. It’s all there – order books, AMMs, wallets, and more – and it’s decentralized! Now, we only have to start building our own liquidity on Stellar.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since every asset and currency starts with zero liquidity when issued on Stellar, it is up to the community to put capital onto the Stellar Network and to put that capital to use for trading, e.g. by creating orders on the order books, to build liquidity on Stellar – i.e. to create and sustain a healthy market for TFT. Therefore, we encourage you all to choose Stellar as the primary platform to trade TFT. If all of us together put our liquidity there, we’ll be able to create a very healthy TFT ecosystem, and thereby also attract others to get involved in TFT. Actually, this is a great chance for us to take back control of and strengthen the token – without any interferences or manipulations from centralized exchanges. Together, we build.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our key objectives is to make TFT more accessible. Already, there are many options to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy&quot;&gt;buy and sell TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettft.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;gettft.com&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or Stellar’s DEX, and more coming soon. We’re also exploring the feasibility and synergies for a meaningful partnership with Algorand – including making TFT available on Algorand order books. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the team is doing some incredible work on developing our own financial technologies, including the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;liquidity.threefold.me&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Liquidity Pool concept and the P2P Wallet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, both expected by early next year.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We’re currently experiencing the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2022-bear-market-has-been-the-worst-on-record-glassnode&quot;&gt;worst crypto bear market&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ever recorded, with a loss in value of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-the-2022-crypto-winter-is-unlike-previous-bear-markets.html&quot;&gt;$2 trillion&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; since 2021 and projects collapsing. Bitcoin recorded a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;07&#x2F;14&#x2F;why-the-2022-crypto-winter-is-unlike-previous-bear-markets.html&quot;&gt;70% loss&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; since last November. While rising inflation rates, a downward market and crypto winter have many projects struggling, these market conditions favour those who are building and providing technology with real-world value over those who are just creating hype. The dust always settles.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While exhibiting at conferences, hosting gatherings and entertaining countless conversations, we were assured that the world is looking for decentralized infrastructure projects that provide truly innovative technology. Still today, blockchain and Web 3 projects hold very low utility. Jack Dorsey’s plans to build a platform called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptopotato.com&#x2F;jack-dorsey-snubs-web-3-for-all-new-web-5-platform&#x2F;&quot;&gt;‘Web 5’&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is just another example of market dynamics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, ThreeFold – hand-picked as a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startus-insights.com&#x2F;innovators-guide&#x2F;web3-startups&#x2F;&quot;&gt;top Web 3 startup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – keeps building the technology for a better world, and we recently got noticed by some major players in the market. More info coming soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In May, we introduced you to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which will interconnect us all, while providing us with digital sovereignty, privacy and meaningful experiences. The Internet of Internets is infinitely scalable and in line with our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;connecting_the_dots&#x2F;&quot;&gt;glocal strategy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It empowers people to build their own regional Internet infrastructures that will be interconnected on a global level.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with each new Grid release, we’re getting one step closer to solidifying the foundation of the Internet of Internets. The team is working hard to further develop and advance the Grid. A massive thank you to our incredible tech team and the community of Grid testers!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid is currently on testnet &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tfgrid-v3-6-0-is-now-live&#x2F;3084?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;version 3.6.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This release includes some significant updates like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;beta.uhuru.me&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Uhuru v1.2 (beta)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, improvements to the app and the wallet, new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfgrid_release_3_6_0?id=tf-planetary-network-v030&quot;&gt;planetary network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; functionalities, on-chain farmer voting, and a lot more. Huge progress was also made on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfgrid_release_3_6_0?id=tfchain-v112&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: DAO support, the support of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;dedicated-node-support&#x2F;2521&quot;&gt;dedicated nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, farm certification, and other features vital to our mission were implemented. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;release-of-tfgrid-3-6&#x2F;3144?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Vote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;releasing ThreeFold Grid 3.6.0 on mainnet&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; now!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide a better user experience and to simplify processes, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfgrid_release_3_6_0?id=tfconnect-app-v360&quot;&gt;TF Connect App&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; received several upgrades and new features like farm management, the Planetary Network, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tf-connect-wallet-v3&#x2F;2565&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Wallet V3&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and many backend improvements.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we made huge progress in &lt;strong&gt;making TFT more accessible&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to the world by launching and evolving the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettft.com&#x2F;gettft&#x2F;&quot;&gt;“Get TFT” platform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which allows anyone to buy TFT &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;get-tft-directly-with-btc&#x2F;1825&quot;&gt;directly with Bitcoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tft-fiat-gateway-beta-testing-program&#x2F;2746&quot;&gt;fiat currency&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we started the year 2022 with about 1,450 3Nodes in 57 countries, we’re now up to more than 3,200 3Nodes connected from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;81 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – thanks to all farmers who built or bought and connected 3Nodes. In early 2022, we officially opened up registrations for validator nodes and are proud to have many amazing validators already verified!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last few months, some of the team has been travelling to places around the world to meet new people, to share our vision and to expand our community on the ground – from Dubai to Miami and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;consensus_2022_recap&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Austin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to the Nile and Zanzibar. We met with investor groups and other blockchain projects with which we’re in discussions around opportunities for collaboration. And we’ll continue to build meaningful relationships with local communities and to explore opportunities around the world to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;connecting_the_dots&#x2F;&quot;&gt;connect the dots&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shared about the historic partnership with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paradise_hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Paradise Hills&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – a key milestone for our Internet of Internets model as the very first partnership for Community Clouds. Together, we’re bringing the world’s largest decentralized Internet Cloud powered by TF Chain into homes in Dubai.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuing our work and projects with key partners like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tfgrid-v3-6-0-is-now-live&#x2F;3084&quot;&gt;ownCloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;ecosystem-developments&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;90&quot;&gt;Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TAG), we announced a few exciting partnerships including &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;threefold_ietsa&#x2F;&quot;&gt;IETSA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and, most recently, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;opennebula_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;OpenNebula&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as well as joined initiatives like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gaia-x.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;structura-x-lighthouse-project-european-cloud-infrastructure-launched-concrete-implementation&quot;&gt;Structura-X&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;As ThreeFold co-founder Kristof de Spiegeleer shared in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-the-real-value-of-tft&#x2F;3143?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;this post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we’re planning to launch FreeFlow&#x2F;Uhuru, an alternative to centralized exchanges, and our DAO. Additionally, dedicated nodes with support for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfgrid_release_3_6_0?id=tfnode-pilot-v010&quot;&gt;Pocket Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, FreeFlow&#x2F;Uhuru and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__weblets_presearch?id=presearch&quot;&gt;Presearch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be made available.

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we’re working on multiple banking projects and country implementations, key steps in the journey to create a truly decentralized world.

		<title>Consensus 2022 Recap – ThreeFold Community Celebrates the  Internet of Internets</title>
		<published>2022-06-28T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/consensus-2022-recap/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Team was in Austin, Texas, in June to share our vision for a decentralized Internet as an exhibitor and sponsor of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_at_consensus_2022&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Consensus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by Coindesk. The four-day conference attracted over &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;consensus-2022-web3-unpacking-regulations-and-optimism-for-crypto-s-future&quot;&gt;20,000 people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who explored conversations on topics like decentralization, blockchain, crypto, Web 3 and more. The ThreeFold team shared our “planet first, people first” vision and story with hundreds of attendees who visited our conference booth to learn about ThreeFold – leading to new community members, farmers, token holders, and partners. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-founder &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;people&#x2F;adnan_fatayerji&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Adnan Fatayerji&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; conducted several media interviews and found that our story resonated well – after all, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_at_consensus_2022&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Consensus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the Festival for the Decentralized World. Nevertheless, many of the other projects at Consensus are still using centralized infrastructure for hosting. We shared the potential for ThreeFold as the foundation to make a truly decentralized world a reality. Already, independent people and organizations from 80 countries and counting are connecting decentralized Internet capacity, bringing to life this new infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As the Layer 0 for Web2&#x2F;3&#x2F;4 or 5, we came to Consensus with open arms and in the spirit of collaboration and that’s exactly what happened. We made friends and connected with the projects out there that are truly moving the needle of ‘Trust’&#x2F;Web3 forward. We look forward to nurturing these incredible partnerships on ThreeFold’s foundational layer and to scale ‘Digital Trust’ in all its forms towards mainstream adoption.” – Adnan Fatayerji&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with some of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yourhomecommunity.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;our Austin friends&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we gathered with 45 like-minded people at Casa de Luz, a spiritual and wellness retreat, to launch the first sovereign Regional Internet in Austin, Texas. All of us shared our own stories and reasons for attending. Then we explored the opportunities, benefits and next steps for Austin to establish its own truly self-sovereign regional Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found shared values among a group of open, inspiring, passionate and like-minded individuals who formed this founding group. Austin has long been a hub for innovative thinkers and high-tech companies. Austin has a strong connection to and respect for nature. Austin is aligned well with our planet-first, people-first philosophy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that, together, we’re strong enough to build new regenerative systems powerful enough to enable anyone to have a sovereign, safer and more fulfilling life. And we’re honoured to be working with the people of Austin in the global rollout of the Internet of Internets. We’re now looking to launch the first 3Nodes there to lay the foundation of Austin’s sovereign Regional Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;threefold_austin_community.png&quot; alt=&quot;ThreeFold and Austin Community&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent a truly incredible week in Austin, spreading the word about ThreeFold, forming meaningful connections and finding a new home. Thank you, Austin!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s been inspiring to meet everyone at Casa de Luz! Feeling so grateful for the opportunity to build Austin’s sovereign Internet together!” – Sacha Obeegadoo&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It was such an honor. I’ll never forget that day. We’re going to do something really beautiful!” – Sam Taggart&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Connecting with the beautiful community of the good people of Austin was absolutely amazing. We really felt at home and Austin is a true freedom vortex in the US where people truly value their free spirits and the importance of staying resilient and independant. We could not have dreamt of a better place to start the Internet of Internets in the US and create the first local internet. Keep it weird Austin!” – Florian Fournier&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founding gathering in Austin was just the beginning. Building meaningful relationships with local communities to start the next few Regional Internets will be a big focus for the ThreeFold ecosystem in 2022. Therefore, we’ll be travelling to various places across the globe to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;connecting_the_dots&#x2F;&quot;&gt;connect the dots&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the upcoming months.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After entering a partnership with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paradise_hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Paradise Hills&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to build the first Community Cloud, planting the seeds for the first Regional Internet in Austin represents another crucial step in our journey to create the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – a glocal model that is infinitely scalable. So, the next few months will be vital for our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;four_phases_of_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expansion phase&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and for building a better future for all of us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we’re building a better Internet by and for the people, the foundation for a better world. An Internet to regenerate our planet and to empower the collective – the many and not the few.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’re proud to join together to build the future we want to live in – whether by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__diy_guide&quot;&gt;building&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;marketplace.3node.global&#x2F;&quot;&gt;buying&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a 3Node, by buying the ThreeFold Token (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;), or by helping us bring the sovereign Internet to your community or region.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce a new 3Node partner for North America on the Global 3Node Marketplace: &lt;strong&gt;Duck Farm Data&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a long-term farmer with an impressive setup, Nelson knows what people looking to start or expand their farm want. And he plans to build out several new models of certified 3Nodes in the near future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Building the Future We Want to Live In – A Four Step Journey</title>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/four-phases-of-threefold/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What started out as an idea for a better Internet about a decade ago has evolved into a global movement that’s building a decentralized, open and inclusive future through &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The journey towards our ultimate vision of a better future for all is a big one, but can be divided into four digestible phases: creation, expansion, Web 4 and velocity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-the-phase-of-creation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-the-phase-of-creation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-the-phase-of-creation&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;1 The Phase of Creation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past six years, we’ve been building up an incredible full-stack, open-source, decentralized Internet infrastructure, all from the ground-up. From creating our own decentralized operating system, to building a Quantum Safe Storage System, a complete far edge cloud computing platform and planetary peer-to-peer network all accessible via a unique Smart Contract for IT on the ThreeFold Blockchain, we’re proud to have the most complete edge infrastructure to power the next-generation Internet era. A new world is coming, and our technology has the potential to revolutionize digitization on a global scale, across sectors. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation phase was about developing the key tech components and an initial deployment of our infrastructure worldwide. The ThreeFold Grid is now live in its third generation and the stack is fully functional. As of today, people from all across the world have connected more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;threefold_io&#x2F;status&#x2F;1529903015938998272&quot;&gt;3,000 nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; across +78 countries to create the world’s largest decentralized Internet infrastructure, and new capacity is being connected every day.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to fully comprehensive decentralized edge cloud solutions, the ThreeFold ecosystem is also developing a range of applications and experiences across IoT, metaverse, blockchain, DeFi, banking, education and beyond.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase of creation is almost complete. The ThreeFold team is currently working on the Digital Twin solution that will allow the ecosystem to tap into Web 4 principles – a paradigm that overcomes the limitations of Web 2 and the inefficiencies of Web 3. By advancing our technology further, ThreeFold will be in a unique position to open new frontiers and support emerging global trends.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-the-phase-of-expansion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-the-phase-of-expansion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-the-phase-of-expansion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;2 The Phase of Expansion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second phase is all about the growth of the ThreeFold Grid and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;connecting_the_dots&#x2F;&quot;&gt;connecting the dots&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. From individual farmers and farming cooperatives connecting Internet capacity independently to our global network, to building Community Clouds and Regional Internets for countries, various pathways to Grid growth have been established by the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Internets will interconnect us all, while providing us with digital sovereignty, privacy and meaningful experiences. It focuses on incentivizing local communities to build their own resilient Community Clouds to support their city, town or village with the foundation to build their decentralized future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on their geographic proximity, Community Clouds will be able to form Regional Internets. Each Regional Internet will be equipped with their own blockchain, validators and liquidity providers as well as local digital experiences in order to remain independent from the rest of the world. In that sense, whatever would happen to the Internet infrastructure outside of the borders of that region would not affect local connectivity and digital economies. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Regional Internets will be interconnected by the ThreeFold Hub on a global level to create the Internet of Internets. This model is infinitely scalable. Instead of relying on one global network and blockchain, ThreeFold will allow for many independent and interoperable Internet infrastructures that support local communities with a platform to build their own blockchain, DeFi, metaverse, IoT, eCommerce solutions, and much more. Each layer has its own distinct purpose and enables seamless ecosystem-wide interactions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paradise_hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the Paradise Hills partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as the first proof of concept for Community Clouds and our team working with governments in multiple countries, we’re following the glocal approach of applying the global Internet of Internets concept locally with regional context. With our growing community and ecosystem supporting us, and building new relationships, we’re well set to turn the Internet of Internets into reality in the upcoming years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phase of expansion will probably never end. ThreeFold is infinitely scalable, and there are many reasons to continue growing the ThreeFold Grid as it is best positioned to service the emerging demand for edge computing and sovereign Internet infrastructure for decades to come.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-the-phase-of-web-4&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#3-the-phase-of-web-4&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 3-the-phase-of-web-4&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;3 The Phase of Web 4&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with the expansion phase, the rollout of the Web 4 phase is expected to kick off later this year to re-imagine business, governance, finance, education and more in order to provide better alternatives for people, enterprises and governments. Essentially, the Internet of Internets is laying the foundational infrastructure, and Web 4 technology will open a world of new possibilities around peer-to-peer and self-sovereign systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Web 4 phase will empower people to become 100% self-sovereign with a range of decentralized alternatives to Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, Chrome, Zoom and much more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multitude of valuable and meaningful experiences are being built by the ThreeFold ecosystem and partners to empower people with equal chances to learn, create, and thrive in a decentralized digital economy – what we like to call an abundance-based future for humanity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to all of this is ThreeFold’s open-source Digital Twin technology. It provides a unique digital identity that can serve as the key to an open, self-sovereign and complete digital future. The Digital Twin technology allows ThreeFold to flip the current centralized client-server model upside down, empowering people to become the masters of their own destiny. No more data being collected by servers and sold to third-parties – you become the center of your digital life. There will be more on Digital Twin and its potential to change everything coming very soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with strategic partnerships being formed across the four corners of the globe, the Web 4 phase will support the ThreeFold Foundation’s vision of providing access to a better Internet paradigm to a billion people by 2030.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-the-phase-of-velocity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#4-the-phase-of-velocity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 4-the-phase-of-velocity&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;4 The Phase of Velocity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the Internet of Internets and the build-up of powerful experiences on Web 4 technology will bring the ecosystem to its fourth phase – Velocity. At that moment in time, it will be all about utilization, economic growth and the acceleration of our collective vision.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tokenomics&quot;&gt;ThreeFold tokenomics&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have been designed to support a decentralized Internet economy that incentivizes participants to host nodes, validate the blockchain and build applications on the ThreeFold Grid. The moment utilization kicks in at a large scale on Web 4, the ThreeFold Ecosystem will be ready to reach millions – and eventually, billions – of users through powerful digital experiences that provide a better alternative than today’s paradigm. As of today, 35% of ThreeFold Token transactions under Proof of Utilization are burned to create a deflationary economy. This will create additional &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__grid_valuation&quot;&gt;value&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the token ecosystem as it will reduce the circulating supply in relation to the increasing demand for ThreeFold’s infrastructure. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, the fourth phase will drive significant utilization of the ThreeFold Token and support in positioning it as the Bitcoin for Internet capacity. It will open up a decentralized Internet economy full of opportunities, empowerment and meaningful experiences for people all around the world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality.” – John Lennon&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve reached a pivotal moment in the evolution of ThreeFold to support our world in solving some of its greatest challenges. A complete and resilient Internet infrastructure owned by local communities is an essential way to build a circular and participatory economy. Considering that the Internet is the second largest and fastest growing economy in the world, the Internet of Internets represents a foundation for a decentralized and abundant world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_of_internets&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Internet of Internets&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; model supports ThreeFold in achieving its vision of providing Internet access to more than a billion people worldwide. And we believe that if we work together, we can connect all of humanity responsibly. Driven by our planet-first, people-first philosophy, the ThreeFold movement is shaping the world we want to live in and laying the foundation for an open, inclusive and abundance-based future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current phase of expansion is vital to turn our vision into reality and to fulfill our mission. Let’s build this world of opportunity and abundance together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Welcome to the Internet of Internets</title>
		<published>2022-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/internet-of-internets/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet of Internets is owned by the people.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It interconnects us all, directly, without any intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Not to control. Not to polarize. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As believers in a better world who choose to act.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is the backbone for the Web, a global infrastructure that makes our digital experiences possible. It represents a network of billions of interconnected computers and other electronic devices, communicating with each other and carrying all of the online information and services that we use on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyperscale data centers owned and operated by big tech corporations make up the “housing” of the Internet today, where all of our digital information, services, and data reside. While these data centers are mainly located in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, no matter where you live in the world, you rely on them to go about your daily digital life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, you might not see any glaring issues here. After all, the Internet is one of humanity’s greatest achievements, and these data centers have until today made the Internet accessible to billions of people around the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, this also means that for those of us who are connected, we depend on a few large tech corporations to act as the gatekeepers of the Internet. They own 80% of the infrastructure and most of the major online platforms, thus owning and capitalizing on our data and turning us all into products. And today, 3-4 billion people still remain unconnected, as these data centers are extremely expensive to build and difficult to maintain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current Internet paradigm is also highly unsustainable, requiring enormous amounts of energy to connect the digital world. We have no choice but to find more regenerative solutions to provide humanity with the tools and infrastructures needed to solve the world’s greatest challenges.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here we face a paradox. Today’s Internet would not exist in its current form if it were not for the centralized model. Yet, how can we continue down a path that has serious implications for humanity and our planet, while being incapable of scaling with emerging demand? Is there another viable solution?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It now exists. Welcome to the Internet of Internets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-starts-locally-and-ends-globally&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-starts-locally-and-ends-globally&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: it-starts-locally-and-ends-globally&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;It starts locally, and ends globally&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Internet of Internets is owned by the people.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It interconnects us all, directly, without any intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We store our data in full sovereignty and privacy.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until today, people have been relegated to Internet “users,” or “clients” in a client-server model – either way, cogs in a big machine (the Internet) that ultimately benefits the few (big tech). But what if we reversed that model? We believe there should not be just one Internet, owned and operated by the few, rather a network of thousands of interconnected Internets, owned by and benefiting local communities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of this new model, community or neighborhood clouds. Essentially acting as a community-owned, decentralized alternative to building data centers, neighborhood clouds provide high-bandwidth capabilities for regional Internets. With high-quality hardware installations and optimized networking infrastructure, neighborhood clouds provide more efficiency and interoperability than any traditional data center setup.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local enterprises and developers can now customize and scale their solutions in ways never before possible. And people living in and around these community clouds can utilize the capacity as they wish, all while taking full control of their own data and interconnecting without intermediaries. This allows for a completely decentralized and localized Internet by the people, for the people. The foundation of the Internet of Internets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community clouds in proximity connect directly with each other to form a network, what we call a regional Internet. These regional Internets have their own blockchains and can operate 100% independent from other regional Internets. A regional Internet starts with 99 founding fathers and mothers who deploy blockchain nodes, with integrated support for DeFi. Each regional Internet has its own ThreeFold Token, and differences in farming and cultivation models are possible depending on the decisions of the regional Internet’s DAO. Further, each regional Internet has its own DeFi pool to allow frictionless exchange between TFT and the regional TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Hub interconnects the Regional Internets to form  the Internet of Internets. Secured by 100 L2 Validators, this is the home of the TFT and the base governance layer for ThreeFold. Here you can see a model which starts locally and scales forever. Each layer has a distinct purpose and allows the ecosystem to interact. And while being hierarchical, it’s still 100% peer-to-peer and decentralized. An Internet of Internets, by the people, for the people – safe, sovereign, and sustainable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-world-of-endless-possibilities-lives-on-top&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-world-of-endless-possibilities-lives-on-top&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-world-of-endless-possibilities-lives-on-top&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A world of endless possibilities lives on top&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On top of it, we build valuable experiences, useful experiences.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Not to control. Not to polarize. Not to addict. Not to manipulate.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rather to connect. To exchange. To share. To provide value for each other.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Internets empowers people to build their own Internet infrastructure. Along with building community-owned Internets, our ecosystem is reimagining education, business, governance and finance for a fairer, more inclusive and regenerative future. The Internet of Internets is opening up a new world of possibilities, and we’re just getting started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Internets provides a regenerative, safe and sovereign Internet infrastructure layer. It offers a secure, private, reliable and high-performing Internet experience. Moreover, it will include a set of experiences, solutions and knowledge that enable all people to equally learn, create, exchange, and thrive online.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Internet of Internets, we’re laying the foundation for a world built on abundance, rather than scarcity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-foundation-for-a-better-digital-world&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-foundation-for-a-better-digital-world&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-foundation-for-a-better-digital-world&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The foundation for a better (digital) world&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A circular economy, to benefit the collective and, as a result, each of us individually.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As believers in a better world who choose to act.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We strongly believe in the ThreeFold Law which states that any good you do will return to you threefold in this lifetime. By making our technology actionable, we energize a collective approach towards a single mission – empowering humanity while regenerating our planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Internets provides a much-needed alternative to big tech that can bring the Internet to even the most remote places in the world in an ethical, sustainable and secure way. It starts locally and ends globally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Internets is based on an equality- and abundance-based paradigm to benefit and provide fair value exchange for the collective and each of us individually. We are driven by a planet-first, people-first philosophy that shapes the future we want to live in. Without our planet, we have nothing. And we believe people need a better system. One they can depend on. One that allows everyone to provide economic flow. One that gives them the opportunity to thrive. One that is able to empower local communities all over the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we’re building our own future through the Internet of Internets – decentralized, open, inclusive, regenerative, and resilient.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>ThreeFold Q&amp;A with Adnan Fatayerji and CyberNews</title>
		<published>2022-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/threefold-cybernews/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/threefold-cybernews/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Q&amp;amp;A originally appeared &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybernews.com&#x2F;security&#x2F;adnan-fatayerji-threefold-the-best-protection-is-ownership-and-sovereignty-over-your-own-online-data&#x2F;&quot;&gt;on CyberNews&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every action done online leaves a trace of our personal data that can then be accessed by third parties. Unfortunately, this puts our privacy at risk and can lead to dangerous consequences.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our sensitive information falls into the wrong hands, one can encounter identity theft and suffer enormous financial losses. Thus, it’s essential to explore how the Internet could become a safer place for everyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cybernews.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;CyberNews&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; asked Adnan Fatayerji, the CEO of ThreeFold Foundation, to explain how blockchain technology can empower users and give them ownership over their own online data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did ThreeFold originate? What has your journey been like?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journey with ThreeFold began in 2015. I was a serial entrepreneur up to this point, inspired by the energy and opportunity Dubai had to offer when I first arrived more than a decade prior. I had recently co-founded a company that worked with panoramic stitching and used an incredible piece of technology – we got a lot of interest and were quickly acquired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, a mutual friend and a business partner introduced me to Kristof de Spiegeleer. He shared his view of the problems with the Internet, with centralized data centers, the Internet’s stack, storage, and computation, and how they needed improvement in ways that serve the underserved around the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristof expressed that he had been trying to resolve these problems for a long time and he thought he had the pieces to the puzzle, especially with the advent of blockchain which offered new and exciting possibilities. He thought we would hit it off, and we did.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve built ThreeFold and even created a new operating system – Zero OS. It is more energy-efficient and runs completely in an autonomous and decentralized way. It’s the first of its kind, built off of Linux.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold journey has been a vast school of knowledge for me while working with incredible co-founders and mentors who have helped build pieces of the IT world as we know it. It has truly changed my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us a little bit about what you do? What are your main fields of focus at the moment?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last five years, I’ve been in charge of the ThreeFold Foundation which is building a global movement around the ThreeFold Grid – a peer-to-peer, open-source, and decentralized Internet. I’m also active in our fundraising, business, and ecosystem development efforts. It’s an honor every day to wake up and be a part of a global movement of people who are trying to build a better Internet for humanity that can uplift and empower.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are focused on building Neighborhood Clouds on ThreeFold that allow home and business owners to transform their own neighborhood into a decentralized, distributed data center by becoming a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Each home, office, or commercial property can host a 3Node – a dedicated server that provides the edge computing and Internet storage needed to run decentralized applications and Internet services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Nodes are interconnected using existing local Internet cable infrastructure. They offer a quantum-safe storage system with the capacity to host a metaverse, gaming, rendering cloud, compute cloud, and a platform for our digital applications that enable our daily digital life. Farmers, in turn, are rewarded every month in ThreeFold Tokens (TFT), a digital currency, for adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently announced a historic partnership in Dubai with Paradise Hills Development to provide every homeowner in a 170-home gated community with a pre-installed 3Node. The initiative will provide residents, businesses, developers, and the government with a secure and highly accessible sovereign cloud infrastructure to run a vast array of applications and internet services, as well as store and process their data locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is evident that open source is an important part of ThreeFold. Would you like to share more about your vision?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned the democratization of the financial system through decentralization, ThreeFold is on a similar quest to democratize the Internet with open-source, autonomous, and blockchain technologies. ThreeFold has built the open-source technology behind the decentralized storage and compute capacity of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Internet users can benefit from a neutral, peer-to-peer platform on which to store their data and run their applications privately and securely. Moreover, decentralization can help to remove the Internet’s singular potential points of failure which could seriously disrupt the global Internet and Cloud industry.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decentralized Internet can also better serve underserved populations of the world, including indigenous populations across the globe. We believe in open-source and we are partnering with technology companies, governments, and indigenous communities to expand the Internet in underserved regions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the recent global events had an effect on the way people approach the blockchain landscape?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent global events have definitely had an effect and spotlighted the fact that we need to consider new approaches to our IT systems with the blockchain landscape being one of them. A good example of the power of blockchain technology along with digital currency is Ukraine’s thriving fundraising. As the war began, a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;i-created-a-dao-for-laughs-want-to-join&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Decentralized Autonomous Organization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (DAO) was set up so that the government could accept cryptocurrency directly from donors.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAOs have several advantages over traditional organizations. First is the lack of trust needed between the two parties. A traditional organization requires a lot of trust in the people behind it, especially on behalf of investors. With DAOs, only the code needs to be trusted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold DAO allows autonomous operation of the TFChain and ThreeFold Grid. At ThreeFold, we believe that decentralization is needed across a wide array of systems, including organizations, to build a better Internet. Decentralization typically brings more resilience, equality, and fairness. As such, we apply this in a variety of ways across our own structures and practices.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, the blockchain community needs to look at the vulnerability of the blockchain’s underlying infrastructure. Today, many are run on centralized cloud services and in a time of conflict can be vulnerable to hacks or attacks. I think this is where ThreeFold aligns so well with the blockchain industry since we provide the missing layer needed to be secure, scale, and remain decentralized.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since blockchain is a relatively new technology, there are still some confusion and myths surrounding them. What misconceptions do you notice most often?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the common misconceptions and misunderstandings about blockchain is that people often think cryptocurrency and blockchain are the same. Blockchain is a ledger and cryptocurrency is an alternative means of financial transaction. Cryptocurrency (or Digital Currency) is powered by blockchain, but blockchain does not need a cryptocurrency to function. 
Here’s how blockchain and digital currency work on ThreeFold:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer 2 (L2): the ecosystem security layer.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; The ThreeFold DAO and ThreeFold Token (TFT) live here. It’s our main chain with 100 validators and it secures the multiple Layer 1 (L1) networks. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer 1 (L1): the Internet of Blockchains layer.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; It’s ultimately scaleable because of thousands or millions of blockchains. It’s like a side chain for the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer Zero (L0): the IT capacity layer and the cloud computer layer.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; ThreeFold executors live on this layer, secured by L0 Validators. L0 provides compute, storage, and network resources to L1 and L2.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the ThreeFold Token (TFT) is the first token in the world that gives access to the most comprehensive, decentralized Internet capacity for computing, storage, networking, and soon GPUs. Look at it as &lt;em&gt;the Bitcoin for Internet Capacity&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users, developers, and enterprises can use TFT to store data, build applications, and create peer-to-peer ecosystems on the ThreeFold Grid. ThreeFold Farmers are rewarded in TFT for contributing capacity to the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As more companies move their workload to the cloud, are there any details that might be overlooked when making the switch?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A vastly overlooked detail about the current cloud landscape is that it is energy-hungry and unsustainable given the rate at which our digital demands are growing today. If your company is working to be more environmentally conscious and meet climate goals, cloud hosting might have been overlooked as a contributing factor.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet’s growth is exponential: 5.25 billion people have Internet access and are active users, so that’s about 66% of the world’s population. Since 2000, the number of Internet users has increased by 1,355%. The rate at which hyper-scale data centers need to be built to keep up with hosting these clouds is unrealistic, and their price     tags are exorbitant considering there are more efficient ways to tackle this issue.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ThreeFold, companies can now literally be their own data centers, without the data security risks, latency and downtime issues, or hosting expenses. We believe that the current centralized cloud infrastructure carries increasing risk and it delivers poorly for underserved populations of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s crazy to think that more than 80% of today’s Internet infrastructure is owned by less than 20 organizations. The lack of ownership of our own data and the consequent commercialization of our data is a major concern for both individuals and governments alike. Neutrality and democratization of the Internet are an absolute necessity regarding the future of the Internet and cloud architecture.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What security measures do you think are crucial both for casual Internet users and large organizations?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting our personal data is crucial for any individual or entity participating online. There are many precautions and measures that can be taken but the best protection is ownership and sovereignty over your own online data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From data breaches to DoS attacks to hacked interfaces, cloud computing is under constant attack. ThreeFold’s decentralized cloud offers improved security through a new, secure operating system, Zero OS, that runs on ThreeFold 3Nodes. It has no shell so that farmers – the owners of the capacity that hosts the OS and the workloads – have no access to the data nor the applications running on their hardware.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This OS is booted over the network with cryptographic boot file verification to prevent physical disk access and man-in-the-middle attacks. All nodes have their own IPv6 address and are fully interconnected in the defined network. Additionally, all traffic on the network is encrypted and inaccessible by TF Farmers or hackers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold also offers a Quantum-Safe File System. This File System can be used inside VMs or Kubernetes. This is an amazing feature because it allows you to store endless amounts of data in a Virtual Machine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also added security. Deployment of IT workloads using a so-called “Smart Contract for IT” makes the deployment process resilient to human error and hacking. The system is self-driving and self-healing, therefore removing the human requirement for deploying and operating IT infrastructure or services. This represents a breakthrough in IT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your predictions for the future of blockchain technology?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once mainstream organizations become more familiar with the technology and how to use it effectively, adoption will increase. It’s already happening and it’s being merged with other emerging technologies to create scale and efficiency across sectors. We will see a new and more refined era of blockchain technology where functional use cases drive the narrative.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share with us, what does the future hold for ThreeFold?&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is growing the ThreeFold Grid by enabling a community of thousands of farmers from around the world to participate and own a piece of the Internet. Check out our map to see if your region is lit up yet. We believe that the decentralized Internet is key to a sustainable future so that we can deliver on the true promise of the Internet and make it more widely available and affordable for all.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are continuously improving the ThreeFold Grid. We just announced the release of ThreeFold Grid V3.0.0 Alpha-5 with significant upgrades, improvements, and fixes. Users can now choose to deploy applications and services on dedicated 3Nodes or reserve an entire 3Node, then use it exclusively to deploy solutions for themselves or other customers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with V3, the ThreeFold Grid is now operating as a DAO. We have also made it easier for users to buy ThreeFold Tokens by trading their BTC on our official &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gettft.com&#x2F;gettft&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TFT Shop website&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are announcing several promising partnerships and use cases in 2022 and are working closely with several nations to help establish a decentralized and sovereign infrastructure that will improve Internet accessibility, security, and locally provisioned capacity.

		<title>ThreeFold at Consensus: A Decentralized World is in Our Hands</title>
		<published>2022-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-05-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-at-consensus-2022/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-at-consensus-2022/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s that time of the year when believers and builders of a decentralized tomorrow  gather to celebrate the festival for the decentralized world. About 15,000 people will attend Consensus 2022 by CoinDesk from June 9 through June 12. Throughout the festival, key topics around decentralization, blockchain, crypto, Web 3 and the metaverse will be explored and discussed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is ThreeFold attending Consensus? Excellent question. The ThreeFold community truly believes that collaboration, decentralization and peer-to-peer systems are the foundation for a better Internet, and subsequently, a better world. And together we are making that world a reality. But we need to grow and extend the community on the ground with the right people, dreamers who choose to act now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many consider Consensus the festival for the decentralized world, some questions linger: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How committed are the projects and participants to decentralization, and for what reasons? How far are they willing to go to bring that world to life?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that many projects in the space still rely on centralized infrastructure – at least to some degree. So, are they really delivering on their promise of decentralization? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-decentralized-world-needs-a-decentralized-foundation&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-decentralized-world-needs-a-decentralized-foundation&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-decentralized-world-needs-a-decentralized-foundation&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A decentralized world needs a decentralized foundation&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we’ve already come to Consensus that decentralization has to start at the foundational level. See what I did there? The ThreeFold co-founders have more than 20 years of experience in setting world records in Internet storage and cloud automation technologies. With ThreeFold, they started from scratch to build a fully decentralized Internet infrastructure that’s peer-to-peer and open source. We’re realizing the promise of an Internet built and owned by the people, back to the vision of Web 1 through the implementation of Web 4 technology. For us, it’s obvious that we simply cannot build a fair and equal digital world on top of today’s old-world infrastructure which is owned by the few. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our fair, inclusive and decentralized Internet infrastructure, we’re laying the foundation for a better world. Following our ethos of &lt;em&gt;planet first – people second – profit (value) only as a result&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, we’re striving to regenerate our planet and to empower the collective – the many and not the few. By putting our planet and people first, we create real sustainable value. We believe that, together, we’re strong enough to build new regenerative systems powerful enough to enable anyone to have a sovereign, safer and more fulfilling life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, people from 77 countries are connecting thousands of computers (3Nodes) to the ThreeFold Grid – all contributing to ThreeFold’s open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. And any node or dApp, actually anything that can run on Linux, can run on top of the ThreeFold Grid in a truly decentralized way. With ThreeFold’s infrastructure and thriving ecosystem, there’s an abundance of potential and opportunities – really anything is possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-consensus&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-consensus&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-consensus&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold @Consensus&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold team and community will soon gather at the Austin Convention Center, 500 E. Cesar Chavez Street, Austin. Meet the ThreeFold team at &lt;strong&gt;Exhibit Booth 310&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; not far from the Networking Lounge. We’ll be there throughout the entire exhibit to connect with participants, share the ThreeFold story and extend the community – Friday, June 10 through Saturday, June 11 from 9am until 6pm.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our booth, you’ll be able to meet the team, see and hold a Titan 3Node, have the chance to win a free 3Node of your own, find resources that will empower you to get involved, and more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold will also host a gathering outside of the Convention Center. We will share more via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefoldnews&quot;&gt;our Telegram News Channel&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; when the details are finalized, so stay tuned.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is more than an Internet. It is the foundation for a truly decentralized world. Are you ready to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;join&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the global ThreeFold movement?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;About 2 billion computers, 15 billion mobile devices and more than 22 billion IoT devices are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;active worldwide&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By 2025, more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;executive-perspectives&#x2F;annual-internet-report&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;1 billion people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;471264&#x2F;iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide&#x2F;#:%7E:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20%2D%20number%20of%20connected%20devices%20worldwide%202015%2D2025&amp;amp;text=By%202025%2C%20forecasts%20suggest%20that,IoT%20installed%20base%20in%202019.&quot;&gt;75 billion IoT devices&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are expected to join the Internet.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the expansion of Internet capacity still largely occurs in the same centralized and inefficient way. The client-server model of hyperscale data centers is unable to meet this rapidly growing demand due to high building and operational costs to fulfill bandwidth, performance and cybersecurity requirements. As data centers are primarily built in the US, China and Europe, emerging countries have to be connected via sea cables which makes the model’s limitations particularly severe for these countries. And even in countries where many data centers are located, they are built in regions where land and electricity are as cheap as possible. Consequently, the bulk of data centers is still &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.securityinfowatch.com&#x2F;perimeter-security&#x2F;physical-hardening&#x2F;article&#x2F;21263002&#x2F;real-words-or-buzzwords-edge-cloud-and-the-evolving-internet&quot;&gt;far away&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from where the majority of users and connected devices reside, and where huge amounts of data are generated that require processing – resulting in a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__grid_valuation?id=what39s-the-potential-of-the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;weak distribution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Internet capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seagate.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;www-content&#x2F;our-story&#x2F;rethink-data&#x2F;files&#x2F;Rethink_Data_Report_2020.pdf&quot;&gt;175 Zettabytes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of data will be created by 2025, as our economy becomes increasingly digital and data driven. And this amount of data needs to be captured, stored and activated in a secure, efficient and high-performing way. So, the aforementioned technological use cases will not only &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbre.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;insights&#x2F;reports&#x2F;north-america-data-center-trends-h2-2021&quot;&gt;accelerate the demand&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Internet capacity but also require edge capabilities, such as low latencies, in order to run and scale successfully. In fact, the centralized data center model poses one of the biggest obstacles to the success and spread of the Internet of Things and related applications. This will have to change. Actually, industry experts &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-scoop.eu&#x2F;edge-computing-explained&#x2F;&quot;&gt;expect 75%&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of data to be processed outside of the traditional data center or cloud model by 2025.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rise-of-edge-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-rise-of-edge-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-rise-of-edge-computing&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The rise of edge computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing needs to be pushed from centralized data centers to the edge to support the massive data consumption coupled to the rise of connected devices and emerging technologies. For instance, as more and more home appliances and devices are getting interconnected through the IoT economy, the amount of real-time data generated within our homes on a daily basis is rapidly expanding. Edge computing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-scoop.eu&#x2F;edge-computing-explained&#x2F;&quot;&gt;tackles the shortcomings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the centralized model in terms of bandwidth, latency and autonomy. It enables applications and solutions to be hosted closer to where their data is being produced and consumed, thereby allowing for low latencies, rapid data processing and real-time decisions. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry analyst company &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idc.com&#x2F;getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48772522&quot;&gt;IDC estimates&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the global spending on edge computing to increase by 14.8% compared to 2021 – amounting to roughly $176 billion in 2022. By 2025, this number is predicted to reach about $274 billion.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of edge computing’s ability to process data on-site is simple enough. Nevertheless, edge computing fails to deliver on its promise as it still remains somewhat centralized today. Granted, so-called edge data centers are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stlpartners.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;edge-computing&#x2F;edge-data-centres&#x2F;&quot;&gt;closer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to where the data is being consumed than hyperscale data centers. But while they do provide an improvement from traditional data centers, they are not able to provide &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefastmode.com&#x2F;expert-opinion&#x2F;23002-what-are-various-types-of-edge-computing-that-exist-today&quot;&gt;far-edge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; capabilities, i.e. moving as close to the user and point of data creation as possible. They are simply smaller types of data centers that are still operated in a centralized manner, require the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;connectorsupplier.com&#x2F;how-the-rise-of-edge-computing-will-reshape-the-data-center-landscape&#x2F;&quot;&gt;same infrastructure elements&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as centralized data centers, and usually &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techtarget.com&#x2F;searchdatacenter&#x2F;definition&#x2F;edge-data-center&quot;&gt;rely&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on bigger, central data centers. Quite edgy isn’t it?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the need for Internet capacity – specifically at the edge – is rapidly intensifying, a new approach to Internet infrastructure is clearly needed. The Web 3 movement created a spur of interest across industries due to its promise to decentralize the Internet and cloud as we know it. Future data will be generated at the edge of the network and Internet which certainly requires an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;forbestechcouncil&#x2F;2022&#x2F;03&#x2F;25&#x2F;demystifying-edge-technology&#x2F;&quot;&gt;architectural shift&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; away from the current model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;realizing-an-interconnected-future&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#realizing-an-interconnected-future&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: realizing-an-interconnected-future&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Realizing an interconnected future&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, decades after the spark of the open-source peer-to-peer Internet movement was steamrolled by large tech companies and governments eager to centralize the global Internet, we seem to enter an era of decentralization again. There’s no doubt that large tech companies did bring a lot of innovation to our global Internet and cloud stack. Technically though, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;p2p_web3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; systems have always been the most scalable option. Moreover, open-source architectures have built a strong reputation for providing high levels of security and flexibility. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a peer-to-peer model, people and devices are able to exchange directly, without intermediaries or servers in the middle – leading to a more energy-efficient, scalable and flexible paradigm that can expand on-demand. And undoubtedly, open-source will play a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.crunchbase.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;edge-computing-said-quissal-zededa&#x2F;&quot;&gt;key role&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in edge computing by simplifying and enhancing the building and deployment of software at the edge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging open-source and peer-to-peer technologies, ThreeFold has come up with an Internet infrastructure that is capable of far-edge computing. ThreeFold offers a powerful set of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;compute primitives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that provide the agility to create and deploy containers, Virtual Machines (VMs) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zkube?id=zkube&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; environments at the edge. Having integrated all leading industry-standard tools, ThreeFold’s solution allows for a seamless migration of any digital workload, making ThreeFold the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. And all data produced by these workloads can be stored in a way that is ultra safe, highly reliable and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;qsss&#x2F;threefold__qsss_home?id=quantum-safe-storage-system&quot;&gt;unbreakable&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Combined with end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__planetary_network?id=planetary-network&quot;&gt;networking&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, applications can be hosted closer to where the data is being consumed – representing the ideal underlying layer for IoT networks, blockchain-based workloads and more to run and scale at the edge seamlessly, efficiently and privately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift towards the edge is inevitable. ThreeFold is the first full-stack, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincheckup.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;decentralized&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure in the world that combines compute in the form of highly-optimized containers, storage and network capacity in an all-in-one solution. With  more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;81 Petabytes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of capacity distributed across thousands of 3Nodes and 76 countries as well as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;connecting_the_dots&#x2F;&quot;&gt;plans&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to sponsor the expansion of the Internet to developing regions, ThreeFold is the foundation for a thriving interconnected future that is secure, borderless and at the edge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Being sustainable’ has become a buzzword – a claim to boost our image rather than an honest endeavour. It is hard to trust people and brands today when we fear to fall into the trap of greenwashing. However, we have no choice but to change our collective behaviour, consumption patterns and business practices if we want to combat climate change and the collapse of biodiversity.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;d41586-021-03431-4&quot;&gt;COP26&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; shed light on how indecisive our global institutions and governments are in the face of an unprecedented climate crisis. We now have to come to terms with the fact that carbon neutrality is no longer enough. Rising carbon emissions have been linked to an increasing amount of heat waves, droughts, floods and hurricanes globally. It is our collective responsibility to reverse the unintended consequences of our actions. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that warnings about the risks and harms of excessive carbon emissions date back as far as the 1960s to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climatefiles.com&#x2F;climate-change-evidence&#x2F;presidents-report-atmospher-carbon-dioxide&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a report&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by former US President Johnson’s Science Advisory Committee? We’ve clearly been inactive and ignorant for far too long. There’s always another crisis, another challenge to tackle. But we cannot afford to ignore climate change and biodiversity loss any longer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;waves_of_crises.png&quot; alt=&quot;Waves of Crises&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to tackle the climate crisis with the same urgency, force and determination we do with other crises. And we finally need to face the reality and severity of the climate crisis! After all, Greta Thunberg is right: “Nature does not bargain and you cannot compromise with the laws of physics.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come for us to put our planet first. It is our duty to regenerate our planet and to support the right practices and organizations aligned with our vision of tomorrow. Now’s the time for regenerative action.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-save-our-planet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-to-save-our-planet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-to-save-our-planet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How to save our planet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.” – Robert Swan&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking action and making the right choices for our planet and humanity, we can prevent the truly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;12&#x2F;23&#x2F;1042973&#x2F;climate-change-action-progress-clean-energy&#x2F;&quot;&gt;severe levels of global warming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and restore the health of our planet. Once emitted, carbon dioxide can persist in the atmosphere for several hundreds, possibly thousands, of years. So, it all starts with reducing global emissions to the lowest level possible. In addition to that, we’ll need to compensate for those emissions that cannot be avoided as well as for all of the carbon and other greenhouse gases we’ve emitted in the past.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most technological solutions for carbon removal remain expensive and early stage, nature-based solutions are the way forward. And trees, as the world’s largest plants, are an effective way to store carbon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what are we doing at ThreeFold? How are we contributing to restoring the health of our planet? How are we taking climate action?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-commitment&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#our-commitment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: our-commitment&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Our commitment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe our planet needs regenerative solutions at a large scale. Our motto is: planet first, people second, profit as a result. Without a healthy planet, humanity can’t survive and no economy can exist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_home&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is already much more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; than the traditional Internet, there will always be energy consumption and emissions that cannot be avoided – and thus have to be compensated for. We’re not just going for the carbon neutrality of the ThreeFold Grid but for carbon negativity (or as we prefer to call it, planet positivity), i.e. offsetting its emissions three times through planting and protecting trees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we decided to empower our community to take part in our regeneration efforts in a low-threshold way. ThreeFold Farmers will automatically compensate for their 3Nodes’ carbon footprint three times, and everybody will be able to use the ThreeFold Grid’s regenerative Internet capacity while simultaneously supporting impact initiatives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we shared in our Planet-Positive Farming Series, we’re setting the plan for a planet-positive Internet by implementing a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive&#x2F;2097?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Voluntary Carbon Credits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (VCC) system and supporting &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;supporting-initiatives-to-regenerate-the-planet&#x2F;2110?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;planet-positive initiatives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with our trusted partners from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;driving-regeneration-with-tag&#x2F;2120?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TAG). &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;driving-regeneration-with-take-action-global&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#driving-regeneration-with-take-action-global&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: driving-regeneration-with-take-action-global&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Driving regeneration with Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re aiming to realize the initial promise of the Internet while also regenerating the planet. Our decentralized Internet infrastructure is already highly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_energy_consumption&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – we’re using about 10 times less energy than any comparable alternative. In December 2021, we &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;threefold-and-take-action-global-partner-to-bring-internet-access-to-1-billion-people-across-the-globe-301446693.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; our commitment to achieve a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;ecosystem-developments&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;90&quot;&gt;carbon double win&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&#x2F;take_action_global&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TAG&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – experts on climate action and education who were &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;threefold_io&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493980240275812352?s=20&amp;amp;t=uW8aclYr82-xqQkEsCeGWw&quot;&gt;acknowledged&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for their incredible work by the Anthem Awards – we kicked off a pilot program for tree planting. After measuring the carbon footprint of the Grid and individual &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we knew what it would take to go beyond climate neutrality and fulfill our planet-positive commitment.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our tree planting initiatives in Sierra Leone, Malawi and Cambodia, we’re planting enough trees in 2022 to lay the foundation for achieving and sustaining a carbon double win for our Internet infrastructure. Already, students and teachers in the three countries have planted more than 5,300 trees. Find out more about the pilot program &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;driving-regeneration-with-tag&#x2F;2120?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and head to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;earthproject.org&#x2F;treeplanting&quot;&gt;EarthProject&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; page for the tree-planting details and how you yourself can get involved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve laid the foundation for the ThreeFold Grid’s carbon double win, we will continue to produce Voluntary Carbon Credits to finance further impact initiatives, such as fostering climate education and renewable energy grid developments to enhance the life of communities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all need to take responsibility and to pull our own weight. But we’re in this together. And together, this will happen. After kicking off our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;driving-regeneration-with-tag&#x2F;2120?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;pilot program&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a month ahead of schedule, we’re well set to achieve the carbon double win for the ThreeFold Grid – driving the regeneration of our planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pioneering the creation of an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;internet_energy_consumption&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and regenerative Internet built and owned by the people. The ThreeFold ecosystem consists of like-minded individuals and partners that share our values and support us in our mission.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global carbon emissions keep rising. Climate change and the collapse of biodiversity are accelerating faster than ever before. And yet, it’s important to believe in our ability to change our behaviour if we are to secure our children’s future. It’s not about being naive or optimistic, but rather a commitment to change and to do better. Across the globe, movements are sprouting to save our planet. How does ThreeFold take part in this? How are we contributing to making the world a better place?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;  &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once emitted, carbon can remain in our atmosphere for hundreds of years. To survive climate change, massive amounts of carbon emissions have to be offset – and fast. According to a UN report, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;07&#x2F;08&#x2F;1027908&#x2F;carbon-removal-hype-is-a-dangerous-distraction-climate-change&#x2F;&quot;&gt;10 billion tons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of carbon emissions will have to be removed on a yearly basis by 2050 to prevent the planet from moving past the 2 degree Celsius threshold. Allowing the climate to heat by just one more degree would have unprecedented consequences – including the sinking of islands and coastal areas, an accelerated rate of extinction (right now, estimations suggest that about &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;e360.yale.edu&#x2F;features&#x2F;global_extinction_rates_why_do_estimates_vary_so_wildly&quot;&gt;24 to 150 species go extinct&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; every day) and much more. Our complacency towards climate change proves that we’re still in denial of the chain reaction and butterfly effects of our past and present actions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, we’ve already crossed the threshold in the climate crisis where we had enough time for long debates on potential measures and policies. The time for those debates was in the 1960s, when a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climatefiles.com&#x2F;climate-change-evidence&#x2F;presidents-report-atmospher-carbon-dioxide&#x2F;&quot;&gt;report&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by former US President Johnson’s Science Advisory Committee first warned about the risks and dangers of excessive carbon emissions. “Climate change is the result of more than a century of unsustainable energy and land use, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production,” said Jim Skea, one of the IPCC Working Group III Co-Chairs in a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enviro.or.id&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;ipcc-press-release&#x2F;&quot;&gt;press release&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; published earlier this month. According to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;report&#x2F;sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a report&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we can still achieve our climate goals if we significantly reduce emissions across all economic sectors. However, we urgently need to take action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to act. Now is the time for bold moves. As Skea put it: “Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-astonishing-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-astonishing-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-astonishing-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The astonishing carbon footprint of the Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people are legitimately obsessing about the emissions caused by air travel and whether to take that plane or not – bestowing us with concepts like ‘flight shaming’ – other industries’ significant impacts almost go unnoticed. One of them is the Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;carbonliteracy.com&#x2F;the-carbon-cost-of-an-email&#x2F;&quot;&gt;chat messages and emails&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; you send out every day. How many times do you &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastcompany.com&#x2F;90171268&#x2F;internet_impact_visualized&quot;&gt;‘google’&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; things? How much time do you spend &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbontrust.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;carbon-impact-of-video-streaming&quot;&gt;streaming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; music or videos? All of your online activities add to your carbon footprint. There are a couple grams of carbon emissions attached to the energy needed to power your devices and the wireless networks you connect to. On top of that comes the significant amount of energy required to support the infrastructure of today’s Internet, namely millions of data centers and the thousands of servers in each of them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the emissions caused by streaming one song or sending one email may seem insignificant, the accumulated use of the Internet by billions of people all over the world adds up. It actually leads to a collective carbon footprint amounting to a share of roughly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think&quot;&gt;3.7% of global emissions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; caused by the Internet and its infrastructure – and these carbon emissions are estimated&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think&quot;&gt; to double&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; within the next three years. This 3.7% share of global emissions by the Internet almost makes the global aviation industry with its estimated &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atag.org&#x2F;facts-figures.html&quot;&gt;2.1%&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; emissions look good.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global pandemic – while decreasing emissions in aviation due to travel bans – has already accelerated Internet consumption and the resulting footprint due to increased streaming behaviour, remote work and more. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cisco.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;en&#x2F;us&#x2F;solutions&#x2F;executive-perspectives&#x2F;annual-internet-report&#x2F;index.html&quot;&gt;1 billion people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;471264&#x2F;iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide&#x2F;#:%7E:text=Internet%20of%20Things%20%2D%20number%20of%20connected%20devices%20worldwide%202015%2D2025&amp;amp;text=By%202025%2C%20forecasts%20suggest%20that,IoT%20installed%20base%20in%202019.&quot;&gt;75 billion IoT devices&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; expected to join the Internet economy by 2025, a more sustainable infrastructure than power-hungry data centers is urgently needed to meet the future growth of the Internet in an ethical and sustainable way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;data-centers-are-power-hungry&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#data-centers-are-power-hungry&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: data-centers-are-power-hungry&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Data Centers are power hungry&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big tech corporations like Amazon, for example, have massive carbon footprints with their corporate facilities, power-hungry data centers, complex operations and more. One larger data center alone consumes up to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacenterdynamics.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;from-the-sensor-to-the-data-center&#x2F;&quot;&gt;120 MW&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – and there are about 7.2 million data centers worldwide, according to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;500458&#x2F;worldwide-datacenter-and-it-sites&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Statista&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Moreover, a data center’s energy consumption accounts for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.datacenterdynamics.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;from-the-sensor-to-the-data-center&#x2F;&quot;&gt;about 40%&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of its operating costs. In 2020, Amazon emitted more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sustainability.aboutamazon.com&#x2F;environment&#x2F;sustainable-operations&#x2F;carbon-footprint&quot;&gt;60 million metric tons&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of carbon dioxide up from about 51 million in 2019. Others like Google try to downplay their energy consumption by switching to renewable energy. While renewable energy is an improvement for sure, it does not change the fact that Google’s energy consumption could &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;robertbryce&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;21&#x2F;googles-dominance-is-fueled-by-zambia-size-amounts-of-electricity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;power entire countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that really a desirable way for us to use the still scarce supply of renewable energy? Shouldn’t we rather focus on the root problem and on becoming more energy efficient in the first place?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step should be to reduce the Internet’s energy consumption and overall carbon footprint. But even then: reducing that energy consumption and transitioning to clean energy will only get us so far – particularly when considering that there simply is not enough clean energy to achieve a complete transition. Those emissions that cannot be cut have to be compensated for. A holistic solution to today’s Internet’s inefficiencies and emissions is needed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December 2021, ThreeFold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;threefold-and-take-action-global-partner-to-bring-internet-access-to-1-billion-people-across-the-globe-301446693.html&quot;&gt;announced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; its commitment to achieve a carbon double win for its open-source peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure, the ThreeFold Grid. The ThreeFold Grid is able to scale anywhere electricity and network exist, using about 10 times less energy than any comparable alternative while being more affordable as well. By starting from scratch at the operating system level, ThreeFold was able to build an Internet infrastructure that is highly &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This infrastructure is already made up of thousands of 3Nodes that are spread across 75 countries and counting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;driving-regeneration-with-tag&#x2F;2120?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TAG), an expert on climate education and action, ThreeFold aims to make the ThreeFold Grid planet-positive by removing its carbon emissions from the atmosphere three times in the form of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive&#x2F;2097?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Voluntary Carbon Credits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While the pilot for this initiative was announced to start in January 2022, ThreeFold and TAG were so eager to take action against climate change, they kicked-off the pilot one month early in December 2021. It is the first step in ThreeFold’s plan to support the use of ‘nature-based climate solutions’ like tree planting to absorb twice more carbon than the ThreeFold Grid emits by 2022. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-silver-lining-on-the-horizon&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-silver-lining-on-the-horizon&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-silver-lining-on-the-horizon&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A silver lining on the horizon&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every industry and organization has to pull their own weight. There is no way around it. Far-reaching actions and transformations are needed across industries to limit global warming to bearable levels. “The decisions we make now can secure a liveable future. We have the tools and know-how required to limit warming,” said Hoesung Lee, IPCC Chair, in an April 2022 &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enviro.or.id&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;ipcc-press-release&#x2F;&quot;&gt;press release&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Together with TAG, ThreeFold leads the way by working on energy-efficient and sustainable solutions for the Internet. The new IPCC report gives us a reason to be optimistic about our future and have hope for the regeneration of our planet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, all it takes right now is widespread support and adoption of more energy-efficient, sustainable alternatives across industries like ThreeFold for the Internet – something that is up to each and every one of us. Let us all take action for a fairer, more sustainable world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Internet economy is largely managed by centralized companies that connect servers and storage space to run web content. These companies are responsible for critical decisions that affect the Internet at large. They decide how user data is collected, stored, analyzed, and used, leaving people with little to no privacy or control over their identity and information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant corporations such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google have been pioneering the Web 2.0 era, also known as the Cloud era. Over the past 25 years, they have built the most efficient data centers and networks to support the growth of the digital world. However, throughout the last decade, the inherent risks attached to the single points of failures and security issues related to centralized servers and APIs have raised major concerns for Internet users and countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rising popularity of blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies, a gold rush around the decentralization of the Internet has already started. While many projects have attempted to decentralize the Internet and the Cloud with blockchain technology, a layer-0 is still missing for Web 3.0 and DeFi to scale to mass adoption.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a project called ThreeFold has joined the race after recently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;kisspr&#x2F;technology-middle-east-lifestyle-blockchain-dubai-079a0c910c55187206c58992347a8a1e&quot;&gt;announcing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the launch of the first neighborhood cloud in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Farming – A Greener Alternative to Crypto Mining</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;bitcoin-for-beginners&#x2F;the-history-of-bitcoin-when-did-bitcoin-start&quot;&gt;October 2008&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, when the financial crisis was in full swing, an anonymous individual or group under the pseudonym ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ published a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoin.org&#x2F;bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;white paper&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on Bitcoin, a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system” that ended up disrupting the financial system and sparked the creation of an entirely new industry: crypto mining.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering that many people view Bitcoin as a commodity, similar to gold, it only makes sense that the process of generating new Bitcoins would become referred to as ‘mining’. In a way, mining is an incentive mechanism to reach consensus in the verification of transactions in a decentralized network. While crypto mining originated from Bitcoin, the system has spread quite widely across the blockchain space.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a decade later, Bitcoin keeps intriguing individuals and organizations all around the world, and has become &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cointelegraph.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;is-bitcoin-a-waste-of-energy-pros-and-cons-about-bitcoin-mining&quot;&gt;one of the most popular&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; financial assets. Nevertheless, criticism and doubts around Bitcoin and crypto mining remain. The most popular cryptocurrency is also frequently brought to the spotlight around its potential affiliations to money laundering, financing of terrorism and cybercrime, as well as the energy the mining process of its cryptocurrency consumes. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cbeci.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the University of Cambridge, the annual consumption of Bitcoin is currently estimated to amount to nearly 140 TWh. The United Arab Emirates (113 TWh) or the Netherlands (109 TWh) had a lower annual energy consumption than Bitcoin &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.zorinaq.com&#x2F;bitcoin-electricity-consumption&#x2F;&quot;&gt;in 2020&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Moreover, news outlets like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2017&#x2F;nov&#x2F;27&#x2F;bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-56012952&quot;&gt;BBC News&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; reported on Bitcoin exceeding the energy consumption of further countries, including Ireland and Argentina. Within the last year, headlines like “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;climate&#x2F;bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Many Countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” in the New York Times or “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;1aecb2db-8f61-427c-a413-3b929291c8ac&quot;&gt;Bitcoin’s growing energy problem: ‘It’s a dirty currency’&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;” in the Financial Times were in no short supply.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the most popular quotes on the topic is Bill Gates’ statement in the New York Times in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;dealbook&#x2F;bill-gates-bitcoin.html&quot;&gt;March 2021&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: “Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind, and so it’s not a great climate thing.” Not that this statement or the awareness of the issue would have prevented Microsoft from launching &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;identity.foundation&#x2F;ion&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ION&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a decentralized digital identity system, to run on the Bitcoin network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why-is-bitcoin-mining-so-energy-intensive-anyways&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#but-why-is-bitcoin-mining-so-energy-intensive-anyways&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: but-why-is-bitcoin-mining-so-energy-intensive-anyways&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;But why is Bitcoin mining so energy intensive anyways?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Bitcoin’s energy-intensive model is the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;16&#x2F;what-is-proof-of-work&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Proof-of-Work (PoW)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; protocol. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;how-does-bitcoin-mining-work&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin mining&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the process of creating new Bitcoins using PoW, requires solving complex cryptographic equations to receive the rewards associated with the creation of the next block in the blockchain. PoW is carried out by computers, known as ‘miners’. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days, a simple computer was enough to mine Bitcoin. However, the difficulty of the mining algorithm increased as the network grew larger and more people started competing to earn the next block’s rewards. On average, it takes &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcoin.org&#x2F;bitcoin.pdf&quot;&gt;about 10 minutes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to solve such an equation and to mine a new block. Today, Bitcoin mining has become a costly and elaborate endeavour – accessible only to large investors that can support powerful supercomputers – at the cost of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technologyreview.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;04&#x2F;18&#x2F;1049331&#x2F;bitcoin-cryptocurrency-cryptomining-new-york&#x2F;&quot;&gt;local communities&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s only sensible that miners are beefing up their machines to increase their chances. In fact, the sector became so competitive that &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;pulse&#x2F;sustainable-crypto-mining-becoming-reality-nameet-potnis&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Intel created&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; dedicated chips and specialized manufacturers for mining servers like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bitmain.com&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Bitmain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were established. With up to 3,250 Watts indicated by manufacturers, the power consumption of such devices averages 28,470 kWh per year if operated continuously. In comparison, the annual consumption of a freezer is estimated between 200 and 500 kWh per year. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, operating a single mining machine is hardly the way to succeed. The biggest Bitcoin miners have fleets of hundreds of machines in so-called ‘mining farms’, carefully maintained and constantly ventilated, to prevent them from overheating. Some of the largest, like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockdalemdd.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;whinstone-us-breaks-ground-build-world%E2%80%99s-largest-bitcoin-mining-facility-rockdale-texas&quot;&gt;Northern Data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Texas, have an energy consumption of 1 GWh per year, the equivalent of the energy produced by about &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energy.gov&#x2F;eere&#x2F;articles&#x2F;how-much-power-1-gigawatt&quot;&gt;3.1 million&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; photovoltaic (solar) panels. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In critical times where humanity is facing serious global challenges in relation to climate change and the collapse of biodiversity, we must rethink the basics of how to decentralize our world. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;are-there-more-energy-conscious-solutions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#are-there-more-energy-conscious-solutions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: are-there-more-energy-conscious-solutions&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Are there more energy-conscious solutions?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;learn&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;30&#x2F;what-is-proof-of-stake&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Proof-of-Stake (PoS)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; mechanisms have proven to be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;how-does-bitcoin-mining-work&#x2F;#toc-downsides-of-mining&quot;&gt;less energy intensive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; than PoW. With PoS, miners lock up (‘stake’) a blockchain’s cryptocurrency on escrow accounts to be granted mining rights. In exchange for this participation, miners receive an interest proportional to their stake as reward. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoS-based blockchains are faster and much more energy efficient than PoW-based blockchains. However, the implementation of a PoS protocol poses its own challenges. For example, it is known for incentivizing hoarding, rather than utilization, and driving centralization. The mining industry is attempting to shift perceptions and move away from its climate-polluting, power-hungry image by powering large mining activities with renewable energies or by offsetting their emissions with carbon credits.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this might sound great at first, it does not resolve the underlying issue of incredibly high energy consumption. Should we really allocate relatively scarce renewable energy resources to such energy-intensive endeavours? Or should we rather look for more efficient alternatives – considering we have all the technology to create more energy-efficient models from scratch – and then support what energy consumption remains with renewable energy? &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what_is_farming&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a decentralized, energy-efficient and meaningful alternative to mining. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-potential-of-the-threefold-token-tft&#x2F;1796&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) are minted whenever new Internet capacity in terms of compute, storage or network is added to the ThreeFold Grid by connecting computers, known as 3Nodes. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contributing decentralized Internet capacity to the ThreeFold Grid, independent people and organizations called ‘farmers’ earn TFT in return – based on a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_capacity?id=why-proof-of-capacity&quot;&gt;Proof-of-Capacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;  (PoC) algorithm. PoC is autonomously carried out by ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;extremely efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; operating system. First, Zero-OS scans the computer’s resources. Then the operating system registers the computing power and Internet storage on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, making the resources available to the entire network – thereby creating a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincheckup.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;decentralized model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Internet capacity provisioning. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.docsend.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;wsru3f9tmeaq62wq&quot;&gt;energy consumption&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of a 3Node can vary, depending on the amount of Compute Units (CUs) and Storage Units (SUs) it holds. “The average consumption for a Titan 3Node is around 26.71 KwH per hour”, says ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;people&#x2F;alexandre_hannelas&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Alexandre Hannelas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farming supports the realization of an open-source peer-to-peer Internet free from centralized servers and authorities. Similarly to Bitcoin, the management of transactions and the issuing of TFT is carried out collectively by the network to create a decentralized Internet economy. In a way, what &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bitcoin_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Bitcoin did to money&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold does to the Internet – while using much &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;less energy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“By using blockchain for what it’s good at and other pioneering technologies, such as peer-to-peer networking, to complement it, we built the most efficient Internet infrastructure in the world, and by far.” – Kristof de Spiegeleer.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing sustainable solutions for our planet is essential to ThreeFold’s ethos which puts our planet and people first. A famous quote, we love and frequently refer to at ThreeFold, is Albert Einstein’s “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we create them.”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our planet needs regenerative solutions at a large scale, and ThreeFold aims to deliver on our promise providing better solutions for our planet and people through our technology. Based on the ThreeFold Grid’s average energy consumption, we’re planting trees with our partner &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;driving-regeneration-with-tag&#x2F;2120?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to offset the Grid’s carbon emissions three times in the form of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive&#x2F;2097?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;Voluntary Carbon Credits&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (VCC). Our VCC system was implemented in the PoC algorithm, so every 3Node mints additional TFT to offset its own carbon emissions based on the power utilization of the individual 3Node per month. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive&#x2F;2097&quot;&gt;process&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is fully automated and executed by the ThreeFold Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s global community of farmers is on a mission to regenerate our planet through the planet-positive ThreeFold Farming which supports tree planting and other &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;supporting-initiatives-to-regenerate-the-planet&#x2F;2110?u=hannahcordes&quot;&gt;impact initiatives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by default. We’re on track to provide a planet-positive Internet and support our partners in their initiatives in fields like climate education, climate action and economic inclusion worldwide.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farming is about so much more than crypto mining. It’s about building a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;authority-magazine&#x2F;the-future-is-now-kristoff-de-spiegeleer-of-threefold-on-how-their-technological-innovation-will-7acc0e51c365&quot;&gt;better Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and shaping the world we want to live in. Together with a community of like-minded people, we’re taking action for a better world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>ThreeFold in Paradise</title>
		<published>2022-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/paradise-hills/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/paradise-hills/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s January 2022. ThreeFold co-founder Adnan Fatayerji sits in the office of Shaher Mousli, CEO of Paradise Hills Development, along with Suhaib Sheikh, COO of the project. Shaher and Adnan are long-time friends and in fact Shaher gave Adnan his first internship in Dubai about two decades ago, while Adnan was in his final year at university.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaher is well-known in the Dubai real-estate market,  for his open-heartedness and transparency, and has a history of always looking for ways to stand out and differentiate himself and his projects. Paradise Hills in itself came from the idea of creating a “paradise” themed model for residents that could even serve as a tropical resting place for birds in Dubai.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-aha-moment&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-aha-moment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-aha-moment&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The “aha” moment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past twenty years, Adnan and Shaher have maintained a strong relationship, and on this day, they are gathering to find a way to work together – to bring things full circle. They discuss how the real estate market is making a strong comeback, and various types of value propositions for future Paradise Hills residents, when the incredible “aha” moment drops. Instead of a standard one-time gift or fee write-off, why don’t we add a 3Node to each residence? A gift that keeps on giving! The room is filled with excitement. They realize that a new dawn in the property and homeownership market is born, combining the unified empowerment of digital and physical assets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;paradise_hills_3node.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paradise Hills 3Node&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, ThreeFold and Paradise Hills will collaborate on a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;paradise_hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;historic partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to create the world’s first neighborhood cloud network, living on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Dedicated servers called 3Nodes will be installed into 170 homes, providing the edge computing and Internet storage needed to run decentralized applications and Internet services. This will give residents, businesses, developers, and the government a secure and highly-available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally. And homeowners will be rewarded in the form of ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) simply by having these 3Nodes connected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-time-to-waste&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#no-time-to-waste&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: no-time-to-waste&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;No time to waste&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly the team puts the idea to paper, and by February the deal is done. In March, the collaboration is announced and makes the rounds in publications like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;paradise-hills-property-development-threefold-090000146.html&quot;&gt;Yahoo! Finance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and on plenty of regional properties. Adnan even begins training the Paradise Hills sales team on how to present the opportunity to potential residents. The speed of the collaboration is proof of a collective commitment to take this leap of faith, and a high-level of trust in each other and the possibilities. Another big reason for confidence: once the modeling was done, it was clear that this could be a massive financial opportunity for residents, one which could even pay off the cost of the house in a relatively short number of years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;paradise_hills_connected.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paradise Hills Connected&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be a standard “appliance” in each Paradise Hills residence, much like a refrigerator or an oven. But this appliance is anything but “standard” – it provides and connects decentralized Internet capacity owned by the Paradise Hills community, and comes with an onboarding guide to welcome each resident into the much larger ThreeFold community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Paradise Hills is adamant about building tools on top of the ThreeFold Grid – digital storefronts for local businesses, peer-to-peer marketplaces and forums or chats for the residents, and whatever else is deemed to be needed. The collaboration with ThreeFold essentially turns Paradise Hills into a sovereign “smart” community, where even the footage from the security cameras on premise can be stored locally and privately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-community-comes-together&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-community-comes-together&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-community-comes-together&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The community comes together&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to a few weeks ago, the early Paradise Hills community gathers together for a gala. ThreeFold co-founder and tech guru Weynand Kuijpers has the chance to speak in front of the group. He speaks about the early days of the Internet, how it was hijacked by Big Tech turning people into products, and how now there is a new model for the Internet by people, for people. “You are some of the first to do this,” he says to the crowd.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;paradise_hills_partners.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Partners of Paradise Hills&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, residents come up and express their excitement, even if they don’t quite understand all the details. One woman in particular asks, “Can you please explain to me how having this device in my home won’t impact my privacy or security?” Adnan goes on to describe how the 3Node is actually there to preserve privacy and security. “A 3Node is just like a solar panel, only instead of electricity, it provides Internet capacity for local usage. In fact, any data that’s in your home is just a fragment of a piece of a puzzle, so it’s inaccessible to you or anyone else for that matter.” Overall, there is a clear feeling that contributing to this new Internet Grid will bring a unifying force to the community, and a deeper sense of meaning for what it means to be a resident of Paradise Hills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-paradise-to-the-world&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bringing-paradise-to-the-world&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bringing-paradise-to-the-world&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Bringing Paradise to the world&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradise Hills is a first of its kind partnership, but it is only the first. We at ThreeFold see incredible opportunities to scale this model across the world, and not only in real estate developments. Imagine if we apply this to lower-income and affordable housing communities, or colleges and universities. Hardware gifted to residents that connect together to form a localized part of a truly sovereign Internet Grid, on top of which useful community tools can be built – all while generating passive token rewards for the residents. A ground-up model. A global concept, applied locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Paradise Hills story inspires you, and you have an idea for how to bring this model elsewhere, we invite you to take action. Head to the ThreeFold Forum, create a topic under the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;about-the-paradise-hills-model-category&#x2F;2632&quot;&gt;Paradise Hills Model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; category, and let’s spread this to the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

No single entity was able to control access to the web as it was built on the foundation of a peer-to-peer network of nodes owned by developers and researchers. Until the dot-com era. Throughout the early 2000s, large corporations took over the web. New platforms like YouTube and MySpace were launched and new infrastructure needed to be built at an extreme pace, starting the data revolution and changing the digital landscape forever. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty years down the line, the Internet’s architecture has become highly centralized – owned by a handful of large corporations that act as the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;28&#x2F;who-owns-the-internet&quot;&gt;gatekeepers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of our digital world. What was once an open and free platform accessible to anyone has long since built up barriers and lost its neutrality. Users are trapped in a cyberspace that exploits their personal data and allows censorship, hate speech, disinformation and political targeting to thrive. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Nevertheless, these incidents are only a glimpse into all the ways we’re being affected and influenced about the way we see the world – by the tech giants and their algorithms. Tech giants like Google and Facebook have been surrounded by a constant stream of data privacy &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;should-big-tech-own-our-personal-data&#x2F;&quot;&gt;scandals&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as more and more whistleblowers expose their misconduct. However, there are plenty of other, hidden players using the tools and algorithms of social media platforms for their own agendas.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filmthreat.com&#x2F;features&#x2F;4-thought-provoking-movies-on-digital-privacy-and-security&#x2F;&quot;&gt;The Great Hack and the Social Dilemma&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are great documentaries that shed light on how the Internet as we know it became compromised. They depict how algorithms are used to mine user data, control information feeds and manipulate our digital experiences. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.politico.eu&#x2F;article&#x2F;cambridge-analytica-chris-wylie-brexit-trump-britain-data-protection-privacy-facebook&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Trump Election and the Brexit vote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; were heavily influenced by private companies like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;series&#x2F;cambridge-analytica-files&quot;&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that manipulated mass audiences through social media.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By purchasing thousands of personal data points collected by social media platforms and analyzing them, companies like Cambridge Analytica are able to not only predict but influence the behaviour of each and everyone of us. Data collection and analysis to such an extent allow these companies to craft and push perfectly targeted messages to users in a way that’s optimized to sway their opinions in favour of whatever agenda they have.  &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 24th of March 2022, the European Parliament and Council negotiators agreed upon the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;variety.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;digital&#x2F;global&#x2F;facebook-google-amazon-apple-digital-market-act-europe-regulation-1235214516&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Digital Markets Act&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (DMA). It seeks to give users more choice by demanding the most popular apps to open up and interoperate with smaller apps. Moreover, the act aims to ensure a fairer market competition by prohibiting certain gatekeeper practices like self-preferencing and targeted advertising. This set of new EU regulations is likely to impact the daily business of tech giants significantly once it becomes law. While the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europarl.europa.eu&#x2F;news&#x2F;en&#x2F;press-room&#x2F;20220315IPR25504&#x2F;deal-on-digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-competition-and-more-choice-for-users&quot;&gt;DMA&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; promises to mitigate some of the issues discussed, it is doubtful that the act will be enough to fundamentally change the current system. This is a step in the right direction, but much more needs to be done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet has become our digital home. It’s impacting our lives in many ways by creating new opportunities, and changing how we communicate and connect. Therefore, it is crucial to restore the Internet’s neutrality to ensure a fair and equal environment. We need an Internet where we can rely on data security and privacy. An Internet where we’re empowered to truly and completely have ownership of and control of our own data. An Internet that empowers us with digital sovereignty.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet used to be a free movement of culture and the Web. It started with an open-source and peer-to-peer vision to connect people. And while Web 3.0 projects are looking to liberalize the Internet as we know it, most of them still rely on centralized Web 2.0 infrastructure to some degree. The world needs better, holistic solutions. ThreeFold is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;realizing_the_promise&#x2F;&quot;&gt;realizing the initial vision and promise&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Internet as an open-source, peer-to-peer planetary mesh network of nodes owned by humanity. It’s a 100% open-source and community-driven project that builds the critical, neutral infrastructure for a decentralized world – one that is built and owned by the people. With ThreeFold, individuals and organizations are empowered to store their data and run their applications on a peer-to-peer network of nodes in a way that ensures their data will not be manipulated, hacked or lost. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powered by a global community, ThreeFold is the world’s largest peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure with a few thousand 3Nodes connected from 74 countries and the neutral foundation for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;authority-magazine&#x2F;the-future-is-now-kristoff-de-spiegeleer-of-threefold-on-how-their-technological-innovation-will-7acc0e51c365&quot;&gt;any current and future IT workload&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. ThreeFold is now on the verge of opening up a new Internet era free from censorship, user tracking and privacy breaches. And anyone can participate in ThreeFold’s model by building or buying a 3Node, and connecting Internet capacity from their home or office – creating a fully &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coincheckup.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold-is-the-decentralized-web-the-future-of-the-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;decentralized Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Connecting the Dots: ThreeFold plans to scale globally</title>
		<published>2022-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-03-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/connecting-the-dots/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/connecting-the-dots/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold started as an idea about ten years ago and is now manifesting itself into the most comprehensive peer-to-peer Internet and cloud infrastructure in the world. The potential of our technology to revolutionize digitization globally is endless and limited only to our collective imagination. In this blog, we share our ‘glocal’ strategy on how we will build our ecosystem, and the exciting opportunities opening up around the world for those interested to join us!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with some background. Today’s Internet is global*. However, it is incredibly centralized and vulnerable. ThreeFold aims to decentralize its infrastructure,  empower people to be sovereign, and accelerate the world’s transition towards open-source systems to build a more inclusive and fair future for all. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A peer-to-peer Internet has an undeniable potential in driving a distributed global economy. This is for a number of reasons – including, but not limited to the fact that instead of relying on centralized cloud providers and tech giants to expand the infrastructure that holds humanity’s data and applications, the peer-to-peer Internet allows any global citizen to participate in the Internet economy by connecting a computer from their house or office to build the decentralized future they want to live in.  Also, while half of the world takes Internet access for granted, it remains  unavailable to the other half.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*So then is the Internet really “global?”&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;empowering-sovereignty-and-economic-freedom&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#empowering-sovereignty-and-economic-freedom&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: empowering-sovereignty-and-economic-freedom&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Empowering sovereignty and economic freedom&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billions of people around the world still remain without access to the Internet or financial services today. Yet many of them have access to electricity and network, and some even already own a mobile phone that could help them access the Internet and financial services. But without fair and reliable connectivity, they remain in the dark. ThreeFold holds an answer here.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet is a human right but it is unequally distributed around the world. ThreeFold enables the realization of an open-source, peer-to-peer Internet that can scale to anywhere electricity and network exists. Everyone deserves access to the Internet, education and financial services to equally learn, partake and succeed, regardless of where they were born, their gender or their socioeconomic status.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-can-threefold-go-truly-global&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-how-can-threefold-go-truly-global&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-how-can-threefold-go-truly-global&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So how can ThreeFold go truly global?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going global is complicated and even more these days with the evolving regulatory and socio-economical landscapes. Thus, it’s important for us to be on the ground. So we will work with our community and ecosystem on one hand, and with governments and regulators on the other hand, for all of us to meet in the middle. We will always aim to be the most transparent, trusted, inclusive and decentralized Internet solution wherever we go. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first step in our strategy is to support the growth of local communities across regions to build local presence on the ground. The only way for a truly decentralized Internet to emerge is to involve people in the building process of it, both on a hardware and software level. We are in the midst of kicking off an extensive global expansion strategy, with grants and hiring plans to grow the ThreeFold Grid across markets and ultimately build strong local communities that can serve potential customers locally. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with these communities, we will develop and grow the ThreeFold Grid, establish our presence with local developers, grow our ecosystem, and collaborate closely with our network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the last year we have made incredible connections across industries including Blockchain, Web 3.0, IoT, Real Estate and Supply Chains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every region is unique and we cannot take the same approach wherever we go. This is where the idea of ‘glo-cality’ comes in – a global concept applied locally with regional context.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;global-concept-launch-of-educational-campaigns-around-the-importance-of-a-peer-to-peer-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#global-concept-launch-of-educational-campaigns-around-the-importance-of-a-peer-to-peer-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: global-concept-launch-of-educational-campaigns-around-the-importance-of-a-peer-to-peer-internet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Global Concept: Launch of educational campaigns around the importance of a peer-to-peer Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s mission is to realize the promise of an open-source, peer-to-peer Internet owned by humanity, and we take this commitment heartedly. The first objective of our global strategy is to allow anyone who wants to expand the peer-to-peer Internet to their neighborhood to be able to find compatible computers and how to get started. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a multi-region approach to scaling the ThreeFold Grid to arise, a decentralized 3Node marketplace will be launched in April 2022. This will allow communities to access a simple, decentralized and certified platform to buy and sell compatible computer hardware locally. As the ThreeFold Grid expands, we will look to go local, as shared below:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;applied-locally-grow-localized-ecosystems-of-developers-and-enterprises-to-productize-the-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#applied-locally-grow-localized-ecosystems-of-developers-and-enterprises-to-productize-the-infrastructure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: applied-locally-grow-localized-ecosystems-of-developers-and-enterprises-to-productize-the-infrastructure&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Applied locally: Grow localized ecosystems of developers and enterprises  to productize the infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most countries are looking for new Internet infrastructure alternatives to protect their sovereignty. ThreeFold’s peer-to-peer Internet supports any current and emerging technological trend in a way that is fully compliant with any local digital laws and regulations. For developers and  enterprises, this includes a peer-to-peer Infrastructure as a service which offers a distributed, quantum-safe storage and a decentralized edge computing platform to host any current or future technology. For institutions, we will offer a suite of advanced infrastructure set-ups for a sovereign and unbreakable Internet infrastructure. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decentralized financial and legal systems are being created along with industry experts from around the world to deliver on cross-border financial freedom, education and Internet access. Along with a strong ecosystem, we are planning to offer a full suite of advanced technological, financial and educational solutions to countries, especially in the global south to bring access to education, Internet and financial inclusion to more than a billion people by 2030.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ThreeFold, we’re committed to building and expanding the open Internet that is owned by humanity. We are always looking at expanding our ecosystem with the world’s best thinkers and talent ready to be at service of a mission that unites us all. If you think this could be you, we’re waiting for you! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Co-Realizing the Promise</title>
		<published>2022-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-03-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/realizing-the-promise/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/realizing-the-promise/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What was once a massive global movement sparked by the idealism of free culture and the net, is now hosting a wave of unintended consequences that may destroy sovereignty and freedom as we know it. The digital revolution and the “democratization” of the Internet promised to lead us to a prosperous and equitable world, one that brought us closer together, eliminating both physical and virtual boundaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth… a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity… Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no matter here.” –  Declaration of independence of Cyberspace – John Perry Barlow – Davos, 1996.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is not the world we live in today. Borders are hardening in our virtual world with the Great Firewall of China and the widespread emergence of Internet “clusters”. Many countries have attempted to turn off Internet services or to prevent free speech. Networks and algorithms turn us into data generators, influencing our daily habits and interests. It’s turning into a big AI-driven machine that commoditizes our lives, leaves the underserved behind and fails to provide sovereignty where we gather.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A centralized Internet which is controlled by a handful of companies is a serious existential threat. The technology that connects us is now used to distract, manipulate, polarize, divide and control the way we think, act and live our lives. If emerging technologies such as IoT, Blockchain and the Metaverse are not hosted on a self-sovereign, peer-to-peer infrastructure owned by all of us, we may be running head down into the matrix.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With billions of people and IoT devices expected to join this broken digital world this decade, we have no choice but to heal our broken information ecosystem if we want to address the challenges we face collectively. So as we move towards a world where tech and science are merging together, how do we ensure a neutral, inclusive and regenerative digital future – one that truly serves humanity and eliminates the barriers that divide us?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The peer-to-peer Internet incentivizes all citizens of our world to connect computers from their homes or offices to participate in a distributed data economy owned by the people. By allowing humans and machines to interweave without intermediaries, a decentralized and self-sovereign Internet can emerge.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simply – there is no good reason that our data is being stored and controlled by others in the information age. Why are we paying centralized companies to handle our information on our  behalf, when it makes us vulnerable to be turned into products, and would take us the same time to do it ourselves?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer isn’t an alternative to the Internet, it’s an alternative to centralized cloud giants. The Internet doesn’t need replacing; it is one of the most beautiful inventions of our civilization, if not the greatest. Which is not to say that cloud providers are completely obsolete. They serve functions that decentralized systems cannot (e.g. big data); but peer-to-peer systems are just infinitely more resilient, secure, private and scalable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In times of exponential evolution and innovation, we have our fears around the Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t need to disconnect ourselves even further from our reality and it is our responsibility to ensure a safe and fair future for the generations to come. A centralized Internet which is controlled by a handful of companies is a serious existential threat. If emerging technologies such as IoT, Blockchain and the Metaverse are not hosted on a self-sovereign, peer-to-peer infrastructure owned by all of us, we may be running head down into the matrix. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential of technology to change the world remains endless and limited to our own imagination. We decide to switch from fear to love, and to move forward as one humanity. It is our responsibility as global citizens to pursue greater collective consciousness.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Update on the 1st Grid Enhancement Proposal</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;🚨 &lt;strong&gt;Update &amp;amp; Next Steps: The First Grid Enhancement Proposal&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear all,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the community for the support on last week’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;upgrade-proposal-for-minting-code-v3-2&#x2F;2447&quot;&gt;Grid Enhancement Proposal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. We are happy to announce that with 97% positive votes, we are now moving forward with this proposal and implementing all of the mentioned points as soon as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this code adjustment on uptime requirements, as well as the rectification of last month’s payout (including the changed uptime requirements), will take some time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any missing payout for last months minting period - payout ASAP&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minting payout for March 2022 - payout 8th of April&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated on the Grid Enhancement Proposal post, payout will happen on the 8th of April instead of the 5th of April to give us some more time to verify the process.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we are now moving more and more to Grid V3, we wanted to explain how &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-deployment-costs-get-calculated&#x2F;2486&quot;&gt;the billing process works&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for deployments. Some highlights:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid V3 has implemented a post billing system, meaning you will get billed for the capacity you are using after you have deployed a workload. &lt;em&gt;No need to spend unnecessarily for capacity you won’t need.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;threefold__pricing?id=discount-levels&quot;&gt;discounts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for workloads if your account has a certain amount of balance. &lt;em&gt;This way you can enjoy cheaper deployments whilst you are holding TFT in your account.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Stake TFT and Become a ThreeFold Validator</title>
		<published>2022-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/stake-tft-become-validator/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is an innovative Internet infrastructure. By applying peer-to-peer technology to the Internet, ThreeFold operates without centralized cloud providers or authorities the management of transactions and the offering of Internet capacity is carried out collectively by a people-powered network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is open-source – its code is public, nobody owns or controls ThreeFold and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, ThreeFold represents the next-evolution of the Internet and is the low-level foundation to support any current or future digital workload including Edge Computing, Web2, Web3, Blockchain, IoT and the Metaverse.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold aims to ensure that no application, big or small, is subject to the limitations of Web3 or the pitfalls of Web2. Its peer-to-peer Internet Grid is infinitely more resilient, secure and scalable than centralized cloud providers like AWS or Microsoft Azure. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;participate-in-the-threefold-l2-validator-program&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#participate-in-the-threefold-l2-validator-program&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: participate-in-the-threefold-l2-validator-program&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Participate in the ThreeFold L2 Validator Program&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; records transactions that happen on the ThreeFold Grid, including Internet capacity (farming), Internet capacity provisioning (smart contract for IT), identity, account metadata and more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;decentralization&#x2F;validators&#x2F;threefold__validators&quot;&gt;Validator nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; support the network by remaining in sync with the ThreeFold Blockchain and recording the chain’s data while validating and&#x2F;or injecting transactions. Essentially, a validator stores and validates transactions aka, mining blocks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With about a hundred L2 validator nodes to join the network, clients will be able to rely on a distributed, peer-to-peer network instead of relying on centralized services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people and organizations rallied to run validator nodes using computing and bandwidth resources – but more are needed to allow ThreeFold to continue to grow. The rest of this post describes how you can help and what’s in it for you.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-run-a-threefold-l2-validator&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-run-a-threefold-l2-validator&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-run-a-threefold-l2-validator&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why run a ThreeFold L2 Validator?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L2 Validators store the records of the ThreeFold Blockchain, the ThreeFold DAO and the development of side chains on the ThreeFold Grid. There are only 50 in the first batch and 37 have already been verified – meaning there are only 13 spots left! Running an L2 validator requires 2,000,000 TFT staked in order to begin validating. This 2,000,000 TFT is the minimum bond needed to begin validating blocks. A validator also earns voting rights in the ThreeFold DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), which is responsible for the operations of the ThreeFold Blockchain and ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a validator node on a computer isn’t a complicated task. For many of us who love ThreeFold, we want to support the decentralization of the peer-to-peer Internet, and running a validator node is a great way to do that. Also, it is a unique and revolutionary project to have in your room or office. Running a validator node requires little electricity, close to zero technical knowledge, and no real time commitments. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;validator-node-rewards&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#validator-node-rewards&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: validator-node-rewards&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Validator Node Rewards&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For their commitment, and as an incentive for their continued participation, validators are rewarded with a share of the ThreeFold Grid’s revenue. By helping the network reach consensus, validators also earn rewards for processing transactions into new blocks or checking the work of other validators because that’s what keeps the ThreeFold Blockchain secure. A minimum of 5% yield is foreseen in the next 2 years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is realizing the initial promise of an open-source, peer-to-peer Internet owned by the people. Anyone can become a validator and participate in the decentralization of the Internet economy. If you are interested in running one, just follow these simple steps:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Create an account (wallet) with the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__threefold_connect&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Connect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; app.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Buy the required amount of TFT to reserve your validator. Find all TFT buying options &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__how_to_buy&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Log into the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; using ThreeFold Connect and go to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;dao&#x2F;validators-signup-l2&#x2F;83&quot;&gt;L2 Validator Signup&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; category.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Follow the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;procedure-to-register-your-l2-validator-node&#x2F;1864&quot;&gt;registration instructions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to become a L2 Validator, and review the checklist of your application before submission.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone from the ThreeFold community will get in touch with you within the next few days to welcome you to the ThreeFold universe. We’ll have a brief call to verify your identity and wallet treasury to confirm your application. The successful verification process secures your spot as a ThreeFold L2 Validator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi friends, particularly those in the farming community –&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you many of you know by now, we came across a bug in the minting code which had a negative effect on some nodes on the TF Grid during last month’s minting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, we want to thank the ThreeFold community for the way they reached out to us in regards to this. 🙏&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These events sparked a discussion on the current uptime requirements and as a result of that, &lt;strong&gt;we created &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;upgrade-proposal-for-minting-code-v3-2&#x2F;2447&quot;&gt;a forum post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with a poll where the community can vote&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; on the changes as suggested.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the poll will be closed on Friday March 18th at 8AM CET. If a minimum of 60% positive votes are achieved, we will implement these changes as soon as we can.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>What Bitcoin did to money, ThreeFold is doing to the Internet</title>
		<published>2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/bitcoin-threefold/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/bitcoin-threefold/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The world’s most famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin, established in 2008 by a person or group of people under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto, is changing the world. With 106 million people owning Bitcoin after only twelve years, the growth momentum is undeniable. The popularity of Bitcoin is transforming monetary systems at large, and establishing trust through irrefutable records.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional financial technologies, Bitcoin provides total control over one’s funds without the intervention of a central authority, such as a bank or government. Bitcoin is decentralized and spread across many computers worldwide. It’s not a company, it’s a protocol. No single person or entity can control, manipulate or influence the network’s operations. There has never been a hack at the network level since Bitcoin launched in 2009.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin sparked a revolution towards decentralized and peer-to-peer systems. The advantage of such systems is that they operate without central authority, can be audited by anyone, and push for collaboration as their designs are public, inviting everyone to take part.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New systems built from scratch, like DeFi (decentralized finance), don’t have the problem of legacy firms, but they face challenges in scaling towards mass adoption. Most of the so-called ‘Web3’ solutions provide the illusion of decentralization but are actually still quite centralized. Others still have to prove their scalability, security and accessibility to become real alternatives to the current tech giants. While that may change, it’s not a given considering the clear limitations they have to overcome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet represents the second largest and fastest growing economy in the world. With plenty of technologies emerging such as Blockchain, Web3, IoT and the Metaverse to name just a few, the infrastructure that holds our digital world together is becoming more important than ever before. However, the Internet is struggling with many issues related to its incredibly centralized model, including a lack of resiliency and scalability, as well as the loss of its neutrality. And these issues keep intensifying.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services alone hosts more than a third of the Internet today. Adding in a few other tech giants, we essentially end up with only four or five companies controlling the majority of the Internet. While the US government has been debating potential regulations and even breakups of big tech corporations, other governments like China or Russia are already regulating certain aspects of the web. However, most regulations have failed to achieve the desired outcomes and are unable to keep up with the pace of innovations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a saying that goes, “If it is free, you are the product.” Social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram are known for being completely free of charge. Their business models and profits are based on collecting, analyzing and selling their users’ data. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcleanhospital.org&#x2F;essential&#x2F;it-or-not-social-medias-affecting-your-mental-health&quot;&gt;Studies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; now show that high social media use correlates with self-reported declines in mental and physical health. The same platforms are being manipulated by private companies that spread political disinformation and polarity. According to internal Facebook &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;5&#x2F;26&#x2F;21270659&#x2F;facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms&quot;&gt;reports&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, 64% of the people that joined extremist groups did so because algorithms steered them there. In an increasingly interconnected world where people are surrounded by smart devices that collect their data 24&#x2F;7, data ownership and control has never been more important than anything else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Bitcoin, many cryptocurrencies have rallied the movement of decentralization, but only a handful hold technology that can bring true impact. What if there was one project out there that could apply the peer-to-peer and open-source fundamentals to the Internet? ThreeFold spent the last six years developing a new Internet infrastructure from the ground up consisting of a new decentralized operating system, a quantum safe storage system, a planetary mesh network and a distributed edge cloud solution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold builds on 20+ years of technological innovations in the cloud automation, Internet storage and cybersecurity markets brought by its co-founders such as Kristof de Spiegeleer – a serial entrepreneur whose technologies have been acquired by Oracle, Verizon, Data Symantec and others. Together, the ThreeFold co-founders decided to start from scratch as they realized it was the only way to achieve a peer-to-peer and open-source digital backbone that secure, private and self-sovereign.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to de Spiegeleer, “ThreeFold holds more technology than all the Web3 space combined.” ThreeFold’s decentralized operating system can run on any computer, including servers, desktops and laptops, allowing anyone to connect hardware from their home or office to the peer-to-peer Internet.“&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what differentiates ThreeFold the most from the crowd is that it’s a project anchored in it’s values and vision. The project always remained far from fake hype, market making or FOMO games like the large majority of crypto projects. With a low market cap today, and its ability to transform the Internet at large, the time to buy &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens (TFT)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is now. “We’re on the verge of signing our first countries and also have use cases across Real Estate, Education, Supply Chain, Metaverse and Blockchain coming up this year,” said de Spiegeleer, “So, we believe we are looking at tens of millions of users on ThreeFold in the upcoming years.“&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Peer-to-Peer Overcomes Web3 Challenges</title>
		<published>2022-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2022-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/p2p-web3/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/p2p-web3/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First coined in 2014, Web3 is now one of the hottest and overused buzzwords in the digital space – the idea of a new iteration of the web, a decentralized environment based on blockchain technology that incorporates token-based economics. The promise of Web3 – decentralization of control and authority from big tech, data security, scalability, and privacy for users – is tremendous. But what is a promise without delivery? Is it possible that we will see major adoption soon?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewstack.io&#x2F;as-blockchain-hype-fades-developers-give-ethereum-a-serious-look&#x2F;&quot;&gt;enterprise blockchain hype&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that happened a few years ago, Web3 seems to be repeating the same story, with lots of chatter but lagging adoption. Millions have rushed to trade crypto and NFTs attached to Web3 – with a lot of this activity based on speculation and hype – but that doesn’t mean they will replace legacy platforms anytime soon. New approaches such as DeFi (decentralized finance) don’t have the same problem of the legacy firms, but they face the challenge of scaling and mass adoption. However, many so-called ‘Web3’ solutions are not as decentralized as they seem, and still have to show they are scalable, secure and accessible enough for the mass market. This all may change, but there are clear limitations that will need to be overcome.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether Web3 is a marketing slogan or a true technological trend, there is a lot of money and technology behind it. Financial institutions are embracing blockchain technology and we are seeing a rising adoption of digital assets across industries. While the idea of utilizing digital currencies to exchange different forms of value in an increasingly digital world certainly makes sense, it’s a bigger leap to say that blockchain alone can support a broad set of use cases, including replacing the current Internet infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet’s client-server infrastructure replicates data and workloads across many computers, and uses tons of computing resources and energy while limiting the scalability of our applications. However, the clear inefficiencies and gaps in security in today’s centralized infrastructures are being challenged by simpler means of building, storing and exchanging data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a clear evolution to the centralized client-server model, but there are  severe challenges sourced from the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;certik&#x2F;the-blockchain-trilemma-decentralized-scalable-and-secure-e9d8c41a87b3&quot;&gt;blockchain trilemma&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between decentralization, scalability and security. Peer-to-peer systems transcend those challenges as they don’t require any valid2ation or verification from a third party, and enable end-to-end connections that can scale limitlessly without the potential of being altered or corrupted by intermediaries. In peer-to-peer systems, all participants are equally privileged, presenting a fairer model. Peer-to-peer represents an incredibly simple and efficient paradigm for organizing our digital world, and has already proven to be the most efficient alternative to centralized information systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put, there is no reason to replicate full sets of data and workloads across many computers, and use tons of computing resources and energy while limiting the scalability of our applications. While there is an increasing reliance on blockchain principles to organize our Internet systems, blockchain also makes things redundant, slow, complex and energy intensive. To be clear, blockchain isn’t the problem, as it is a great technology to store and exchange value in a decentralized way, but it is only one piece of the puzzle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By inter-connecting the computing processing power and storage capacity of billions of computers worldwide in a peer-to-peer way, data transfers could happen end-to-end between people and machines without the need to be verified. Peer-to-peer is also the only way to achieve a truly self-sovereign Internet – creating a ‘trustful’ environment that allows users and developers to have real data ownership.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer systems aren’t meant to replace blockchains – they represent a way to decentralize models that blockchain cannot, such as Internet infrastructures. Peer-to-peer systems and blockchains, side by side. The best of both worlds. Peer-to-peer as the most efficient and decentralized alternative for us to exchange data and Internet resources. And blockchain for establishing trust through an irrefutable record of transactions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rise of emerging technologies, a new technological foundation is needed to protect our sovereignty and freedom. The rise of blockchains, while well intended, ultimately has made the technological space more complex than ever before, and still benefits a plutocratic few (relative to its promise). More than just technology, peer-to-peer opens a world of new possibilities for humanity to co-initiate new paradigms and experiences.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By applying blockchain and peer-to-peer technology to the cloud, ThreeFold solves the security and autonomy issues of the Internet and realizes the initial promise of the Internet as an open-source, peer-to-peer, planetary mesh network of nodes owned by the people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support the realization of a peer-to-peer Internet owned by the people today:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold farming refers to the act of connecting a 3Node to the ThreeFold Grid – providing Internet capacity to a globally distributed peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. Farming is a decentralized and energy-efficient way for people to expand a new Internet infrastructure instead of corporations building hyper-scale data centers. It’s also a way to extend the Internet to underserved regions of our planet, which cannot afford data centers. Every ThreeFold Farmer around the world contributes to the growth of the foundation for a self-sovereign, private and secure digital world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;3node_example.png&quot; alt=&quot;3Node&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can start farming by hosting a computer at their home or office and taking part in the decentralization of our global Internet and Cloud economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-become-a-threefold-farmer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-become-a-threefold-farmer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-become-a-threefold-farmer&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why become a ThreeFold Farmer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s Internet model is highly centralized, owned and operated by the few. It has turned people into products, is too harmful for our planet, cannot scale to meet emerging demands and connect the billions who are being left behind. These alone are powerful reasons to participate in ThreeFold farming and participate in the growth of a new peer-to-peer Internet economy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the Internet is the second largest and fastest growing industry in the world after the financial markets. With the Internet expected to triple in size by 2025 to meet the data requirements of emerging technologies such as blockchain, Web3 and IoT, we need more capacity and especially in underserved regions of the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;basics-of-threefold-farming&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#basics-of-threefold-farming&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: basics-of-threefold-farming&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Basics of ThreeFold Farming&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is a peer-to-peer network of computers (known as “3Nodes”), including servers, desktops and laptops, that creates an open-source, decentralized Internet. People who connect computers to the ThreeFold Grid (known as “farmers”) are rewarded with ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) on a monthly basis for meeting the required uptime necessary for users to access their workloads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of connecting decentralized Internet capacity and thereby creating new ThreeFold Tokens is described as farming because it resembles the process of farming in agriculture. With agricultural farming, farmers cultivate the land and earn revenue from their harvests. With ThreeFold, farmers connect decentralized Internet capacity and earn ThreeFold Tokens every month for achieving a certain uptime.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above model represents the building block for a distributed, edge infrastructure that can scale to anywhere electricity and network exists, to meet emerging data demands while also providing the self-sovereignty, privacy and security features to achieve true net-neutrality.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-fair-economic-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-fair-economic-model&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-fair-economic-model&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A Fair Economic Model&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold was created to realize the promise of an open-source, peer-to-peer Internet. As such, ThreeFold farming rewards all farmers equally according to the amount of Internet capacity they provide to the network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold Tokens are rewarded for the amount of Internet capacity added and kept connected to the network. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;Farming rewards&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are calculated according to the compute, storage and network capacity made available by the computers:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 TFT per Compute Unit (2 vCPU and 4 GB memory) per month&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12.5 TFT per Storage Unit (1 TB of SSD and HDD) per month&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.38 TFT per Network Unit (1 GB of data transfer)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.06 TFT per public IP address per hour &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above prices are based on the price of 1 TFT equalling $0.08. The farming rewards are pegged to the U.S Dollar and the price is locked from the time a farmer gets started to incentivize early contributors to the network. When the price of TFT rises, the farming rewards will decrease.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farming rewards are designed to be “reviewed” by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;decentralization&#x2F;dao&#x2F;threefold__tfdao&quot;&gt;the ThreeFold DAO&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (a decentralized autonomous organization owned by the ThreeFold community) according to the growth of the ThreeFold Grid and the utilization of its decentralized cloud to ensure a fair distribution of the token economy while also ensuring that farmers will always be justly rewarded for their contribution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin mining and other blockchains became famous for requiring enormous amounts of computers and power to solve complex mathematical equations to win the chance of earning the famous cryptocurrency. Since then, many other projects have been born and carried on the mining concept.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s model is inclusive and planet-friendly. The decentralized operating system built and used by ThreeFold is extremely lightweight, allowing the peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure to be up-to 10x more energy efficient than the data center model and up-to 100x more energy efficient than Bitcoin mining.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure was built in such a way that it removes the need for human intervention or maintenance to eliminate all unnecessary backdoors that open the possibility for ransomware and cyberattacks. Once booted, the decentralized operating system runs forever as the whole infrastructure was designed to be self-driving and self-healing. This 100% autonomous model allows for a completely decentralized system while also enhancing the security and privacy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While blockchain remains an incredible store of value, it is neither an efficient nor a scalable solution to store data and run applications. Only a peer–to-peer model can scale the Internet infinitely and efficiently.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are important factors to consider for ThreeFold farming profitability: &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;computer-hardware&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#computer-hardware&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: computer-hardware&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Computer Hardware&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers are encouraged to use the latest computers, including servers, desktops, and laptops that come with an AMD and Intel processor. The computer should have at least 1 Terabyte of SSD to optimize the performance of their farming activity. It is recommended to buy a ThreeFold 3Node server from certified partners around the globe that comes pre-configured and ready to run on the Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used or refurbished computers can be used but it is important to understand that older computers are less efficient and more power-hungry. Computers not older than 4 years are recommended. Please visit &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;c&#x2F;farming&#x2F;diy-farming&#x2F;43&quot;&gt;the DIY section of our forum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for support and feedback on farming setups.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;power-costs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#power-costs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: power-costs&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Power Costs&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical power is the  main operating expense. Electricity is charged per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The cost of farming can float from $0.10 to $0.35 per kWh. It is important for a farmer to verify the expected power usage of a computer before starting the operation to improve profitability.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that the price of kWh varies depending on the country. Find a country power cost average comparison &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electricrate.com&#x2F;data-center&#x2F;electricity-prices-by-country&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;threefold-token-price&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-token-price&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-token-price&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Token Price&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incentive to farm ThreeFold Tokens is because of its future potential. What Bitcoin did to money, ThreeFold is doing to the Internet. While Bitcoin and Etheruem have already reached high market caps, ThreeFold is just getting started.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farmers are rewarded a given amount of TFT monthly based on the amount of Internet capacity they provide to the network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the price of TFT is $0.1, the profitability of the farm will be average. If the price of TFT is $0.3  your farming operation may operate with healthy rewards. If the price of TFT is $1 your farming operation will be highly rewarding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farming rewards are also locked until 30% utilization for a period of 2 years to incentivize early participants. The earlier you start your farming operation, the greater the rewards along with the growth in the value of TFT.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right mix of the above elements make farming an attractive venture. If the variables are favorable, farmers can scale up operations and earn more rewards.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can start farming by hosting a computer at their home or office and take part in the decentralization of our global Internet and Cloud economy. Considering ThreeFold’s market cap alongside the growing demand for a decentralized Internet, there’s no better time than now to get started farming!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer networking is a rather complex phenomenon with a thankfully intuitive outcome: you send messages from one place to another. We all understand that our digital devices become a lot less interesting when they are not connected to the Internet. However, networking is not just Internet, and when it comes to building a new Internet, it’s important to understand what that means.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing Internet can be defined as a global set of networks and protocols that enable us to do things like load web pages and use apps that rely on external data. It depends on lots of underlying infrastructure, including fiber optic cables running along the ocean floor, our home routers and their connection to an Internet service provider (ISP), lots of cell service towers, and an increasing number of satellites. All of that makes the Internet possible, and it’s still required for a new Internet to function.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; uses and builds new protocols to create a network that is interoperable with the existing Internet. These include private overlay networks, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on Yggdrasil, and various interfaces to the public Internet. Let’s see how they work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-overlay-networks&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#private-overlay-networks&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: private-overlay-networks&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Private overlay networks&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every deployment on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__tfgrid_primitives?id=network-uses-nu&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; belongs to a network, which is one of the Grid primitives. These networks allow data to be transmitted between workloads in a private and secure manner. They are called overlay networks because they pass traffic over some underlying network. That could be within a single node or between nodes on infrastructure provided by a farmer. The Grid uses software called WireGuard for this purpose, a simple, fast, and secure option among its alternatives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By means of encryption, the traffic on a private overlay network is unreadable to any other device on that network. Likewise, the workloads within the private network have no visibility of the underlying network. Individuals who deploy workloads can access their networks over a secure tunnel, assuming that one of the nodes in the network is reachable from the public Internet. This is suitable for workload administration and some private applications. For public services and peer-to-peer communication, the ThreeFold Grid provides other solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;planetary-network&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#planetary-network&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: planetary-network&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__planetary_network?id=planetary-network&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an implementation of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yggdrasil-network.github.io&#x2F;about.html&quot;&gt;Yggdrasil Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which is a next generation approach to network routing. It is a peer-to-peer solution where all traffic is encrypted and takes the shortest path to its destination. These features make it highly compatible with the ethos and goals of the ThreeFold Grid: privacy, security, and efficiency. The design also allows nodes, workloads, and users to communicate freely without relying on centralized intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro?id=threefold-farming&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; connect their nodes to a home router which blocks all inbound traffic by default. This is a sensible feature that doesn’t interfere with most Internet usage (enthusiasts who want to host their own website or a gaming server might bypass this, for example). However, nodes on the Grid need to be reachable, especially in order to receive workload definitions from deployers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planetary Network solves this by accepting inbound traffic through an outbound connection to a publicly accessible peer. You can think of this like making a call to an operator and then waiting for another call to be routed to you on that line. Even if your phone is set to block all incoming calls, someone can still reach you if they can reach the operator.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also provides a way for workloads to communicate with one another and be reachable by users. Anyone can enable the Planetary Network on their own device to access sites and services in a very &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;secure and private&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; way. While the ThreeFold Grid is designed to be fully interoperable with the existing Internet, the Planetary Network provides an alternative which can sit side by side in a seamless way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Planetary Network, nodes and Grid users can send messages over the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;manual__rmd&quot;&gt;Reliable Message Bus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Notably, it is used for the delivery of workload definitions as mentioned earlier. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;all-you-need-to-know-about-zero-os&#x2F;1734&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; supports some other RMB messages as well, for doing things like checking available capacity on a node in real time. RMB is a general purpose protocol that can be used by developers in their applications. It queries the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a kind of address book for the Planetary Network, enabling nodes and users to find each other in a decentralized way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;public-ips-and-web-gateways&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#public-ips-and-web-gateways&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: public-ips-and-web-gateways&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Public IPs and Web Gateways&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let’s see how the Grid can offer services over the public Internet using public IP addresses and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;web-gateway&#x2F;&quot;&gt;web gateways&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Everytime we type a domain name into our browser, like threefold.io, it is resolved to an IP address. The browser then forms a connection with that address to retrieve the site we’re looking for. Reviving a theme from earlier, that IP must be publicly reachable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;public-ips&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#public-ips&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: public-ips&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Public IPs&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re in the midst of a shift from the older IPv4 standard to the newer IPv6 standard. While IPv6 has plenty of addresses for every device on the planet and many more, it hasn’t been universally adopted yet, and IPv4 addresses are in short supply. You likely have one assigned to your router at home, and these days, even getting a second one from your ISP can be a difficult and expensive proposition.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid allows farmers who own blocks of IPv4 addresses to rent them out to deployers. These addresses get attached to individual workloads which are then reachable over the public Internet. A deployer could then assign their own domain name to that IP and host a website there. This is a very flexible way to make Grid deployments publicly available, but it comes at a relatively high cost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;web-gateways&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#web-gateways&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: web-gateways&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Web Gateways&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__webgw&quot;&gt;Web gateways&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are another way to make workloads on the ThreeFold Grid available over the public Internet. In this case, the farmer may provide a domain name that points to one of their nodes which is publicly reachable. Deployers are then able to reserve a subdomain, like explorer.threefold.io is a subdomain of threefold.io, that routes traffic to their workload. It is also possible for a deployer to point their own domain to the gateway node which then routes traffic to the appropriate workloads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We glossed over a bit in the earlier description of domain name to IP address resolution. In fact, multiple domains can point to a single IP address and this is common practice among existing web hosts. Adding similar functionality to the Grid helps to ease the demand for IPv4 addresses and is a lower cost solution for deployers than renting a dedicated IP. The web gateway also serves to enhance security and reliability of Grid-hosted services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gateway provides a connection from the public Internet to the secure private overlay networks that all workloads use. However, this is not a standard network connection but instead a network socket, which provides security through separation. This is something like passing along the contents of mail pieces without their envelopes. Web gateways also enable redundancy, as multiple gateways can point to the same workload, and multiple workloads can serve the same set of gateways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say the ThreeFold Grid scales limitlessly, this is one of the ways that’s true. Many nodes, many gateways, many applications, and many users can all fit into this model. Deployers can start with a single &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__weblets_vm?id=virtual-machine&quot;&gt;virtual machine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and a single public IP like in the example I’ll use to wrap up this piece below, then ramp up to a globally distributed and highly redundant system as their requirements grow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;send-receive-complete&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#send-receive-complete&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: send-receive-complete&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Send, receive, complete&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve seen how the ThreeFold Grid handles networking. From private and secure communication between workloads, to next generation &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; communication and full compatibility with the existing Internet, these offerings are comprehensive. Not only that, but they can be pretty darn fun to play with too.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own recent experience, I deployed a virtual machine on the Grid with a public IP and hosted a simple website with a map of nodes on the Grid that I’d been working on. I was able to quickly share it with some colleagues and members of the community. It went from a project I was tinkering with on my own computer to a live site on the Internet in a matter of minutes, thanks especially to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;tf-deep-dive-session-5-threefold-grid-architecture&#x2F;1756&quot;&gt;networking features&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final piece of this series, we’ll see how everything comes together to turn computer code into a meaningful digital experience. Stay tuned!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to switch between blockchains? Cross-chain bridges allow you to easily transfer TFT from one blockchain to another. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the launch of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__threefold_grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 3.0, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has been available on three blockchains – Stellar, Binance Smart Chain and the Substrate-based ThreeFold Blockchain (aka TF Chain).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are already active bridges that connect Stellar to Binance Smart Chain and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, improving the accessibility and availability of TFT, while also connecting the ThreeFold ecosystem to external blockchain networks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about TF Chain in our blog post &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-bridges-and-why-are-they-important&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-bridges-and-why-are-they-important&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-are-bridges-and-why-are-they-important&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What are bridges and why are they important?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of bridges in crypto is similar to a bridge in the physical world. Bridges in the real world simply connect two different locations and communities so that the people can travel back and forth and resources can be exchanged freely.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, using bridges in blockchain allows users to easily transfer tokens and other crypto assets between two or more networks – regardless of the different protocols, tooling, and governance models these networks have. Simply put, a bridge ensures a secure interoperability between different blockchains.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold uses blockchain bridges to connect external blockchain networks to the ThreeFold ecosystem. The bridging mechanisms we’ve implemented allow TFT to be transferred securely between &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__money_blockchain_partity_link&quot;&gt;different blockchains&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Currently, we’ve established &lt;strong&gt;two 2-way bridges&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar &amp;lt;&amp;gt; Binance Smart Chain&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellar &amp;lt;&amp;gt; TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is the difference between the 3 chains?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stellar.org&#x2F;?locale=en&quot;&gt;Stellar&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is an open-source network for storing and moving digital assets, and still remains the main blockchain for the minting of TFT and distribution of farming rewards. Until the launch of TF Chain with Grid 3.0, only TFT living on Stellar were accepted for the reservation of Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.binance.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;smartChain&quot;&gt;Binance Smart Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (BSC) is a standalone, parallel Binance chain that is a leading DeFi ecosystem next to Ethereum. On BSC, TFT is implemented as a cross-chain asset, allowing anyone to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bridge.bsc.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;connect&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to the bridge using &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_bsc_metamask&quot;&gt;Metamask&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__threefold_wallets?id=the-threefold-connect-app&quot;&gt;Trust Wallet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – the most popular Web 3 wallets in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; was built on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substrate.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Substrate framework&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with the purpose of decentralizing user-farmer relationships on the ThreeFold Grid. It has its own native form of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which can be bridged back and forth from Stellar-based TFT. This model will be implemented for other chains in the future, for interoperability and cross-chain features between blockchain and DeFi ecosystems and the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-s-new-with-tf-chain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-s-new-with-tf-chain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-s-new-with-tf-chain&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What’s new with TF Chain?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TF Chain represents a leap forward for simplicity in payments for capacity reservations and a move towards greater decentralization of the systems that support the ThreeFold Grid. With the launch of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;what-is-new-in-tfgrid-3-0&#x2F;1133&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid 3.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, TF Chain became the official record of ThreeFold farms and nodes, and brought peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;billing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on smart contracts for workload deployments on the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, minting will remain on Stellar but reservations of nodes and capacity on ThreeFold Grid 3.0 are already executed via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Bridges were established between Stellar and TF Chain to facilitate payments, e.g. if you pay for a workload deployment in Stellar TFT, this payment needs to be bridged to TF  Chain’s native TFT to fund the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__smartcontract_it&quot;&gt;smart contract&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-two-way-bridge-between-stellar-bsc&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-two-way-bridge-between-stellar-bsc&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-two-way-bridge-between-stellar-bsc&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The two-way &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bridge.bsc.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bridge&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between Stellar &amp;amp; BSC &lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the bridge between Stellar and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was one-way only: from BSC to Stellar. Even though it was possible to transfer TFT from Stellar to BSC via  &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;threefoldfoundation&#x2F;tft&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;bsc&#x2F;bridges&#x2F;stellar&#x2F;transfers.md&quot;&gt;command line&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, this was only an option for tech-savvy people. Now, you can also deposit TFT from Stellar to BSC using the bridge with a proper UI, as you can see in the image below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tft_bsc_bridge.png&quot; alt=&quot;tft_bsc_bridge&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When depositing from TFT Stellar, &lt;strong&gt;please be sure that both addresses and memo are as indicated&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; in the instructions or the TFT you transfer will be lost forever. To facilitate the process, a &lt;strong&gt;QR code&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; is generated and can be scanned using the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__threefold_connect&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Connect app&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, automatically filling in the right address and memo on your behalf.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tft_bsc_transfer.png&quot; alt=&quot;tft_bsc_transfer&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Binance Smart Chain is a more expensive chain, &lt;strong&gt;a fee of 50 TFT&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; will be automatically charged for the bridge from Stellar to BSC. Find the full &lt;strong&gt;step-by-step guide&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; for the Stellar-BSC bridge &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tft_bsc_bridge&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the ThreeFold ecosystem continues to grow, we’re looking into building more bridges (e.g. Cosmos, Ethereum) to improve the accessibility of TFT and simplify the onboarding of blockchain and DeFi projects on the ThreeFold Grid. TF Chain will play an important role in the further development of the People’s Internet, so give our blog post on TF Chain a read &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_chain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was an important year for ThreeFold, with huge developments on the ThreeFold Grid, the continued expansion of the grid by farmers, key partnerships, and more – all setting up for a strong 2022.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a quick look back at the year that was.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-threefold-grid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January we launched ThreeFold Grid 2.4 on Mainnet and evolved it through version 2.8. In September, we launched ThreeFold Grid 3.0 on testnet and just this week, we launched TF Grid 3.0 on mainnet, with limited capacity for now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold Grid 3 brings a massive leap forward in the decentralization of the ThreeFold Grid and makes for a much simpler user experience for farmers and grid users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The starting point ThreeFold Grid 3:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, we introduced a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__certified_farming&quot;&gt;certified farming program&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;farming rewards 3.0&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which will apply from ThreeFold Grid 3.1 onwards (end Jan).

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, our goal for the ThreeFold Token is to be available at as many entry points as possible. We’re planning integrations with many ecosystems like Cosmos to achieve great networking effects for the money networks. There will be discounts for Utilization based on pre-purchasing of TFT, and more.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no other project out there like ThreeFold. TF Grid 3 is here, the grid is continuously growing across the world, and this collective effort is uniquely positioned to truly decentralize the Internet. Remember: ThreeFold is inevitable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here we go! You can expect many more updates soon on what was covered above. And may the year 2022 be full of health, happiness and opportunities for all of us!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be reminded we are a decentralized movement, we need your help to let us all “BE THE INTERNET.” Become a farmer, register for a validator, contribute to our movement, develop a solution on top of TF Grid … If you’re not sure how to help out but want to, please get in touch on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;t.me&#x2F;threefold&quot;&gt;our two-way chat&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or here on the forum.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Built on the Substrate framework, TF Chain represents the layer-0 for all current and future technologies to provision decentralized Internet capacity. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is Substrate to begin with? And what exactly does our TF Chain do?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-tf-chain-and-what-is-substrate&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-tf-chain-and-what-is-substrate&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-tf-chain-and-what-is-substrate&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is TF Chain and what is Substrate?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the universal smart contract layer on the ThreeFold Grid. It’s an application-specific blockchain customized for the operation of a single application – provisioning decentralized compute, storage and network capacity. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;substrate.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Substrate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a blockchain-building framework from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.parity.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Parity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that allows developers to simply create future-proof solo blockchains or parachains for any use case. Parity was founded by Ethereum’s co-founder and first CTO Gavin Wood in 2015, and went on to develop Substrate to power a multichain, interoperable and decentralized Internet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-we-choose-substrate-for-our-tf-chain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-did-we-choose-substrate-for-our-tf-chain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-did-we-choose-substrate-for-our-tf-chain&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why did we choose Substrate for our TF Chain?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substrate brings clear benefits to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in relation to its frameworks for developers, its interoperability with other blockchain ecosystems and its huge community. More than 150 projects from NFTs to DeFi are already building on it.  &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a solid, mature and secure layer for custom blockchains, Substrate is built for adoption. The blockchain framework was built with the programming language Rust and is modular by design. Choosing Substrate allowed our developer team to leverage great blockchain constructs and efficiently build TF Chain instead of re-inventing the wheel. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its flexible, modular and composable architecture enables our team to focus on what matters the most – the unique demands of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. For example, we’ve built  a Grid module with specific functionalities for farms and nodes. Just like a chef can invent a new recipe and add it to a menu, Substrate allows our developers to build and add as many custom functionalities to TF Chain as we’d like, in a fully decentralized way. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major benefit that comes with TF Chain being built on Substrate is the native compatibility with the Polkadot ecosystem, opening up the opportunity for ThreeFold to become a parachain on the Polkadot network and seamlessly bridging to other Substrate-based chains in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For ThreeFold to be a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;quest_decentralize_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;truly decentralized&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure, people should be able to use Internet infrastructures from anywhere without any intermediaries like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. TF Chain serves exactly that purpose. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It orchestrates the provisioning of compute, storage and network on the ThreeFold Grid via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;threefold__zos&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, removing all forms of intermediaries present in today’s centralized IT infrastructures. Put simply, TF Chain allows people to provide and use cloud resources in a 100% decentralized way. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-tf-chain-do&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-tf-chain-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-tf-chain-do&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What does TF Chain do?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is responsible for achieving consensus on all Internet capacity transactions on the ThreeFold Grid and to store them in a historical record. This prevents users from “double spending” their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and ensures the correct execution of Internet capacity provisioning via smart contracts, while also protecting the network from potential attacks. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An exciting feature that comes with TF Chain 3.0 is a totally new peer-to-peer billing framework for Internet capacity provisioning and workload deployment. This module allows for all functionalities of the ThreeFold Grid to be provisioned peer-to-peer between users and farmers. Therefore, the ThreeFold Token now also lives on the Polkadot network, allowing it to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;bridges_connecting_threefold_ecosystem&#x2F;&quot;&gt;bridge back and forth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the Stellar network and potentially from other chains in the future.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While TF Chain builds on the Substrate framework, most of its functionalities are custom-built to fit the specific needs of the ThreeFold Grid – from Internet capacity provisioning, workload deployments, and payment and billing processes, to digital twin creation and much more. By executing all these actions via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in an automated and decentralized way, the activity on the ThreeFold Grid is always secured by blockchain technology and available to other users for open collaboration. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Farms can now be registered on our new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tech_update_admin_portal&#x2F;&quot;&gt;TF Chain Portal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-future&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-future&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-future&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Future&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Internet capacity provisioning and workload deployments are already executed via TF Chain, the minting of TFT according to the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__proof_of_capacity&quot;&gt;Proof-of-Capacity algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; remains on the Stellar blockchain for now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building our own application-specific blockchain represents a major step towards decentralizing the ThreeFold Grid and ecosystem – a &lt;strong&gt;massive thank you&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to our developer team for this great achievement! 🙏&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-update-explorer-interface/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to present to you the new Explorer UI for ThreeFold Grid 3.x! 🎉&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Explorer was designed to provide &lt;strong&gt;a simple way for anyone to find decentralized Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and we’re thrilled to announce a new user interface for Grid 3.x on both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.test.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;testnet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.dev.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;devnet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new explorer builds upon the recent migration to the Parity Substrate, &lt;strong&gt;bringing true decentralization&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to the way compute, storage and network capacity information is sourced from 3Nodes. The previous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;explorer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (used for 2.x) has been sourcing its information from a centralized database as TF Chain was still under construction. Now, the new explorer receives its information via &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__explorer_graphql_intro&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;straight from the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__grid3_tfchain_init&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockhain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;graphql.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;GraphQL&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open source data query language for APIs. The GraphQL interface queries our blockchain and displays the information registered on it in a command-line interface. We, in turn, created a graphical representation of that information in our explorer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-to-expect-from-the-new-explorer-ui&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-to-expect-from-the-new-explorer-ui&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-to-expect-from-the-new-explorer-ui&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What to expect from the new Explorer UI&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__explorer_home&quot;&gt;Explorer UI&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; allows you to &lt;strong&gt;explore the available Internet capacity&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; connected to ThreeFold Grid &lt;strong&gt;easier than ever before&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. As of now, the new Explorer displays data about the compute, storage, network and gateways connected to the Grid 3.x testnet and devnet by ThreeFold Farmers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistics section gives you &lt;strong&gt;an overview of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.test.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;key information&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; about our testnet (as of November 30th, 2021) as displayed below. Our farmer community has already connected &lt;strong&gt;more than 100 nodes (across 16 countries)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, and we have seen &lt;strong&gt;more than 1,400 contracts deployed&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; on the ThreeFold Grid 3.0 testnet since its launch.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_explorer_statistics.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_explorer_statistics&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All screenshots in this post are from the ThreeFold Grid 3.x testnet Explorer, and the numbers are growing continuously.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a farm ID gets registered to &lt;strong&gt;the new &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;manual__tfchain_portal_home&quot;&gt;TF Chain Portal&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, all the relevant information (e.g. uptime, nodes specifications, location) of farms are automatically displayed on the Explorer for users to find their ideal decentralized Internet capacity. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can now explore all farms and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&#x2F;&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;multiple filtering options&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; (e.g. farm name or farm ID), making it simpler than ever before to find the decentralized Internet capacity they are looking for. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the new Admin Portal is about? We’ve covered all the details in &lt;strong&gt;our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-the-tf-chain-admin-portal-for-farmers-and-grid-users&#x2F;1526&quot;&gt;previous update&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, check it out!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also made the world map bigger to improve the display of the available decentralized Internet capacity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>Introducing the TF (Chain) Admin Portal – for farmers and grid users!</title>
		<published>2021-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tech-update-admin-portal/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week, we shared an update on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;whats-new-in-tf-grid-3-0-1-and-the-path-to-mainnet&#x2F;1488&quot;&gt;what’s new in TF Grid 3.0.1 – and the path to mainnet!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; There’s been a lot of exciting progress by the team, and we wanted to share with you some more specifics where we can – starting with the admin portal!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-admin-portal&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-the-admin-portal&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-the-admin-portal&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is the admin portal?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the requests from farmers and grid users was a to have a simpler user experience. The admin portal (aka TF Chain UI) is a response to that feedback, a graphical user interface for farmers and grid users on top of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;manual&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__tfchain&quot;&gt;the TF Chain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The admin portal is the starting point for anyone to start working with the TF Grid.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; For Farmers in particular they now have a much simpler way to create a farming identity and then connect their infrastructure to the ThreeFold Grid 3.0. It is a one stop shop to start a farm. Beyond that, it’s a way for any TF Grid user to create their account on the TF Chain, get a Twin, and get started (testing for now) on the TF Grid 3.0 devnet or testnet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find links to get started at the bottom!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The admin portal is a place for TF Grid users to:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an account on the TF Chain and a digital twin to start smart contracting on TF Chain (allowing you to also link to your IP address for added security).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operate a bridge between Stellar and TF Chain on Parity Substrate (deposit TFT from Stellar, or return unused TFT to the Stellar chain, the bridge is active in both directions)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_deposit.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_deposit&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For farmers: create and manage your farm(s), provide IPv4 addresses available for your farm(s), attach a Stellar wallet for TFT payouts, and a link to download the bootloader for testnet and devnet (mainnet is on its way).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_your_farm.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_your_farm&quot; &#x2F;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portal also links to the new capacity explorer, which we’ll share more about early next week.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;tf_chain_node_resources.png&quot; alt=&quot;tf_chain_node_resources&quot; &#x2F;&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, all of these tools existed, but not always in the same place or with a clear and easy-to-use UX&#x2F;UI. We’ve tested this portal with people of all technical levels, and the response has been great! We believe the portal is a huge step forward for anyone using or managing the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More improvements will come in the next versions. As an example, we’re planning for you to be able to see the connected nodes linked to your farm with their status, earned tokens, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>A Journey through the Decentralization and Blockchain Space – Part Four: Storj</title>
		<published>2021-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-10-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/project-comparison-4-storj/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the fourth part of our journey through the decentralization space. After exploring &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dfinity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_2_akash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and most recently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_3_filecoin&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we’ll now explore Storj to find out what we have in common and where ThreeFold stands out. Here we go!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;storj-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#storj-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: storj-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Storj &amp;amp; how the project compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&quot;&gt;Storj&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a decentralized cloud storage (DCS) solution founded in 2014 by Shawn Wilkinson, offering cloud object storage on its network of nodes and ISPs spread across different countries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold and Storj are both open source projects that view transparency as an integral part of their business philosophy. Actually, ThreeFold is the first full-stack blockchain-enabled &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to be made open source – all of our code is open source and available for everyone to review or use. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similarity is that security and privacy are crucial aspects of our projects. Both are private by design and believe it’s vital that every person has total &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;control and ownership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; over their data – not even Storj or ThreeFold can access the data of users within their respective ecosystems, creating trustless environments. Storj provides security and privacy by encrypting the data by an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;overview&quot;&gt;Uplink client&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; before it is uploaded to its DCS. The data is then split into pieces which are distributed across different nodes and ISPs connected to Storj’s cloud network. At ThreeFold, we’re creating an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;entirely secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer IT ecosystem that empowers users and gives them back control and ownership of their own data. We’re &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; across all dimensions of our solutions – from our operating system Zero-OS to Quantum Safe File System (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;QSFS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;planetary-network&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Storj does not have its own operating system, we’ve built our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from scratch. It allows servers to run autonomously and workloads to be hosted securely, preventing them from administrative exploits and errors. The self-driving and self-healing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zero_os_blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;features&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Zero-OS eliminate backdoors, reduce the hacking surface and remove the need for human involvement.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects are compatible with certain IT tools and protocols. While Storj is  S3-compatible and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;integrations&quot;&gt;integrates&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a couple of developer tools like FileZilla or Fastly, ThreeFold is highly compatible with leading industry standards and tools from S3 to Docker containers, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;grid-utilization-plan-part-one&#x2F;1157&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and more. Moreover, ThreeFold can run anything that runs on Linux, allowing for a seamless migration of any digital workload, even from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;traditional cloud providers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; like Microsoft Azure or AWS. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A difference between the projects is that Storj focuses on providing the storage layer for developers to build storage applications like Dropbox upon, rather than offering such services themselves, whereas our energy-efficient full stack &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; includes solutions like the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;marketplace&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Marketplace&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of ready-made peer-to-peer applications that runs on our Edge Virtual Data Center (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;cloud#&#x2F;cloud__evdc&quot;&gt;eVDC&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;). Moreover, we’re working with innovative teams and developers to develop self-sovereign &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;interview_with_jimber&#x2F;&quot;&gt;alternatives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to commonly used applications (e.g. video conferencing, office tools).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;network-storage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#network-storage&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: network-storage&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Network &amp;amp; Storage&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Storj’s decentralized network, uploaded data is automatically spread across nodes in different countries. The storage capacity on Storj’s network is increased whenever a new node is connected to it. There are roughly 9,6 Petabyte of data stored on Storj with nodes in more than 80 countries, whereas roughly 85 Petabyte of storage, compute, and network capacity are deployed on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Currently, the nodes connected to our Grid are spread over more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&quot;&gt;50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Storj only offers storage capacity, ThreeFold provides storage, compute, and network capacity. Moreover, our system is endlessly scaleable, whereas Storj’s scalability is limited as it does not empower people without technical skills to contribute and has more complex structures, such as its Satellite component which will be explained further down. We’re continuously extending our reach and our system is capable of seamlessly growing on demand, as it enables anyone to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;become a 3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on our ThreeFold Grid. Moreover, our self-driving and self-healing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is unique in the space and removes the need for monitoring and maintaining the nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage nodes on Storj are responsible for storing and returning data reliably. While Storj generally allows anyone with the excess capacity and bandwidth to run a node on its network, the project does not offer certified hardware. With Storj, anyone who wants to become a node operator has to build their own nodes which have to meet the specific hardware &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;node&#x2F;before-you-begin&#x2F;prerequisites&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of Storj. At ThreeFold, our technology was designed to scale to anywhere electricity and bandwidth can be found to meet local digital infrastructure needs, to empower the unconnected and to drive our vision of an interconnected world. This is also why we’re working with certified hardware partners to provide &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.threefold.tech&#x2F;index.php?route=common&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;plug-and-play&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 3Nodes. These 3Nodes enable even people without technical skills to join and contribute to what we like to call the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;People’s Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;we believe&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that everyone should be given equal chances and that Internet access is a human right.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next to the storage nodes, there are two other &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;overview&quot;&gt;main components&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the Storj network: Uplink and Satellite. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;definitions&quot;&gt;Uplink&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is Storj’s umbrella term for any application that stores or retrieves data and encrypts, encodes, and coordinates data with other services. Storj’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.storj.io&#x2F;dcs&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;satellite&quot;&gt;Satellite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; consists of a set of storage node services like storage node reputation, data repair, billing and more. Storj users have to sign up for accounts on Satellites and pick a specific Satellite to trust. While any user could run their own Satellite in theory, Storj recommends users to create an account on a Satellite that is hosted by a third party like Storj Labs to reduce complexity. This approach, however, fosters centralization, whereas our peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;smartereum.com&#x2F;189750&#x2F;threefold-is-audaciously-building-a-new-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open system where anyone can provide and utilize cloud resources without any intermediaries. On top of that, we’ve implemented cryptographically-secured deployment specifications, called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;Smart Contracts for IT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to ensure that workloads run as intended in a tamper-proof way, and allow systems to scale and heal autonomously without intermediaries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;tokenomics-payment-methods&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tokenomics-payment-methods&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tokenomics-payment-methods&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Tokenomics &amp;amp; Payment Methods&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects have native utility tokens. While the Storj token is an Ethereum-based token that represents a unit of storage capacity on the Storj network, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Tokens&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) can represent either a unit of compute, storage or network on the ThreeFold Grid. Some Storj community members &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.storj.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;the-elephant-in-the-room-where-is-the-storj-token-utility&#x2F;12452&quot;&gt;criticize&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; a lack of utility of the Storj token, as storage capacity on Storj can be purchased and paid for not only in Storj token but also using fiat payment options like credit card or invoice. However, Storj themselves don’t see this as an issue and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;storj-token-balances-and-flows-report-q1-2021&quot;&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that the intention behind their tokens is to facilitate the provision and receipt of data storage and not to create a digital currency or any other kind of financial instrument. In contrast, our ThreeFold Tokens are the fuel for IT capacity, as they allow people to hold current and future cloud capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. Moreover, a limited supply of four billion ThreeFold Token has been set to keep the currency scarce, while the burning mechanism simultaneously ensures continuous rewards for current and future nodes. Find out more about our two algorithms, Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) and Proof-of-Utilization (PoU), in our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;threefold__tokenomics&quot;&gt;tokenomics&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By connecting storage nodes to Storj’s network and providing storage capacity to others, node operators get rewarded with Storj tokens which they receive &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;storj-token-balances-and-flows-report-q2-2021&quot;&gt;from Storj Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as a centralized payment operator, whereas ThreeFold Token are already rewarded upon the connection of capacity to our Grid. Moreover, storage capacity on Storj’s network can only be purchased with a subscription-based &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.storj.io&#x2F;pricing&quot;&gt;model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. With ThreeFold, anyone can become a farmer and be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;rewarded income&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in the form of ThreeFold Tokens for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the Internet by contributing cloud capacity. ThreeFold Tokens incentivize an open and autonomous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; system free from any type of intermediary. We’re enabling anyone to become an independent farmer, as we believe in empowering people and that no single entity should have the power to control systems. Based on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which will be released on Testnet 3.0 soon, a new discount as well as &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;billing model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be introduced. The latter will allow users to authorize &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to automatically deduct their wallets according to the capacity they use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we both share the same vision of a decentralized Internet. The biggest difference between Storj and ThreeFold is that Storj is focused on providing storage, whereas &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; does not only provide storage but also compute and network capacity. While Storj seeks to be the storage layer for the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;quest_decentralize_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;decentralized Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold provides the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;low-level primitives&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; decentralized Internet: compute, storage and network. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’re the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;largest&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, most advanced peer-to-peer cloud infrastructure in the world and are expanding fast, some aspects of Storj’s storage network still function in a rather centralized manner, such as their payment model and Satellites. In addition to that, we’re providing the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. The project could therefore &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;benefit&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from moving on top of our fully decentralized, highly energy-efficient and autonomous &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Together, we could drive the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.econotimes.com&#x2F;ThreeFold-DFINITY-and-the-race-to-Decentralize-the-Internet-1618367&quot;&gt;decentralization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of storage capacity all over the world. We believe in a world without boundaries, where people are able to share information, value and knowledge without limits nor intermediaries. To achieve this vision and to effect change at a large scale it takes collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for coming along and joining me on this journey through the decentralization and blockchain space. After four stops, we’re taking a break.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee created the web server and browser in 1990. Back then, the web was of a free, rather decentralized nature in which no single entity was to control the access to it. With the client-server architecture of the web, however, centralization came about. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__why_intro?id=everyone-should-be-autonomous&quot;&gt;Nowadays&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the web as well as the Internet in general are highly centralized. There are only a few companies acting as gatekeepers to large parts of today’s Internet. The Internet as we know it is continuously &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theconversation.com&#x2F;web-3-0-the-decentralised-web-promises-to-make-the-internet-free-again-113139&quot;&gt;struggling with issues&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; related to its centralized nature – from censorship and attacks on net neutrality to manipulation attempts from companies with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;28&#x2F;who-owns-the-internet&quot;&gt;monopolistic power&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. These issues are systematic and major players like Amazon or Facebook are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techmonitor.ai&#x2F;boardroom&#x2F;power-of-tech-companies&quot;&gt;benefitting&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the situation as it is. This business model is also highly reliant on centralized hyperscale &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data_leaks&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data centers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that also come with a whole set of issues, from their vulnerability and limited scalability to their extremely high energy consumption &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;and more&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People have become the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;product&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of a business model where companies offer their services in exchange for personal data – in order to capitalize on and exploit the data, basically squeezing people out for their data like oranges for juice. In times where &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techradar.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;why-personal-data-exploitation-has-become-the-norm&quot;&gt;data exploitation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the norm, it makes sense that data is often referred to as digital oil or gold. Moreover, algorithms of social media platforms increasingly lead to content provoking controversy and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thereboot.com&#x2F;creating-decentralized-social-media-alternatives-to-facebook-and-twitter&#x2F;&quot;&gt;addictive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; engagement as this type of content tends to increase the time people spend on the platforms – with shocking impacts like The Wall Street Journals’ &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-facebook-files-11631713039&quot;&gt;investigation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; “The Facebook Files” and The New York Times’ audio series &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;22&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;rabbit-hole-prologue.html&quot;&gt;Rabbit Hole&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; show.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these issues have strengthened the push towards decentralization, mainly associated with the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. However, many of the projects in the decentralized space still rely on centralized providers or structures to some degree. The second most-popular blockchain in the world, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;decentralize_blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Ethereum&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, for example, has 60% of its nodes run on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;centralized cloud providers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with 25% of them running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_2_akash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a blockchain-based cloud computing platform, prevents unutilized capacity from centralized cloud computing services from going to waste. Leveraging this underutilized cloud capacity, however, also causes Akash to be highly dependent on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.orchid.com&#x2F;akash-networks-greg-osuri-on-decentralizing-cloud-computing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;centralized capacity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dfinity’s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; platform for decentralized apps (dApps) is based on an ecosystem of independent data centers, which makes it rather centralized on an infrastructural level. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the previously mentioned projects are all seeking to push decentralization, they all have one thing in common: they rely on centralized structures or providers at least to some degree and therefore, are not fully decentralized yet. So, what does &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;decentralize_blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;true decentralization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; look like?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;mission&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to transform the Internet and Cloud and to create borderless opportunities for humanity. Therefore, we‘re truly committed to decentralizing the infrastructure behind the Internet to scale current and future digital workloads. At Threefold, we’re building an entirely &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;new infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; from the ground up, starting with a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of new, neutral capacity and our operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zero_os_blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Our ThreeFold Grid, based on open-source &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, enables an autonomous, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and energy-efficient infrastructure that allows for unlimited scalability while remaining affordable. Our Grid is the largest and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;most advanced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; peer-to-peer infrastructure in the world, already available in more than &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&#x2F;&quot;&gt;50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and keeps expanding fast. With our energy-efficient full stack &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, uniting compute, storage, and network, we are much more comprehensive than other projects. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At ThreeFold, we believe in giving power to the people by developing technologies that empower individuals, enable social participation, and foster collaboration. We’re enabling even people without technical skills to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;join the network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.threefold.tech&#x2F;index.php?route=common&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; offered through our certified hardware partners. The ThreeFold Grid is therefore &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;more inclusive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and allows any individual to participate. Our peer-to-peer nature removes the need of centralized servers and any type of intermediary, allowing applications and data to live closer to where they’re being utilized. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, we believe that no one but you should own your data. Our technology empowers every user to be &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data sovereign&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, giving them full control over their own data by using a variety of innovative technologies, such as autonomous IT, blockchain, and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; networking. This way, our technology is turning traditional IT upside down, enabling a data-sovereign Internet that gives users &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;control&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and ownership of their data in an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;entirely secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer IT ecosystem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, we provide the low-level primitives for a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;decentralized world&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, enabling any project to run on a fully decentralized, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and self-healing infrastructure. As we truly believe in collaboration to effect change at a large scale to fully decentralize the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;Internet and Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&quot;&gt;partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; ecosystem keeps growing. Most recently, we announced a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&#x2F;owncloud&quot;&gt;strategic partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with ownCloud, an alternative to public clouds with more than 200 million users worldwide, that aims to advance the decentralization of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;owncloud_threefold&#x2F;&quot;&gt;consumer cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we’ve recently been exploring decentralized &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;projects&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to see where ThreeFold is in the space and where we stand out, we thought it’s a good time to also look into how we compare to traditional, centralized cloud providers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud market is a highly complex and competitive one, currently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.srgresearch.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly&quot;&gt;dominated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by the market leaders Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure who account for more than half of the worldwide cloud revenues. This centralized nature of today’s cloud as well as its hyper-scale data center model are the cause for various issues, ranging from the monopolistic power of the few big market players and vendor lock-in effects to the incredibly high energy consumption of data centers and the limited scalability of the current model. Moreover, traditional data centers are more prone to outages and cyber attacks. We believe the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; built by independent farmers around the globe and our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provide a solution to all of these issues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While centralized cloud providers do offer some benefits, such as robust feature sets and huge customer service teams, there are a few key and important differences we think any customer would care about:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest and most obvious difference. Today, big tech holds a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.srgresearch.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly&quot;&gt;monopoly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the Internet and Cloud markets, meaning they somehow became the gatekeepers of what was originally intended to be a distributed, neutral Internet. When using AWS or Google Cloud, the data is stored in centralized data centers owned by private corporations. These data centers are susceptible to hacking and outages that can take down massive chunks of the Internet. In this system, people have become products, as they exchange their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data_leaks&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for “free” online experiences. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, data is stored fully decentralized on the peer-to-peer ThreeFold Grid, where the physical hardware is owned by independent ThreeFold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the data is owned by as well as only accessible to the person(s) who put it there. So, hackers can’t get in and due to the decentralized nature of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, large-scale outages would be much less likely as well. Further, no organization or entity needs to be trusted and people are not treated as products – with ThreeFold’s infrastructure, the Internet is owned &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;by the people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Limitless Scalability at the Edge&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lightweight operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes it possible and even easy to install a node close to where the data is being consumed. There is no need for large servers, nor for heavy power supply installations. Together with our hardware partners, we’re offering &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play functionalities, allowing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;anyone to participate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This makes our model infinitely scalable at the edge. Hyper-scale data centers are not able to provide these levels of scalability and edge benefits. In order to scale their operations, centralized cloud providers need to build more data centers and take care of the related maintenance which takes time and costs billions. The traditional data center model also isn’t well suited for the edge, as this requires flexibility and close proximity to the respective data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralized clouds are secure, but vulnerable. At ThreeFold, we pride ourselves on the levels of security we’re providing. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nature of our technology means end-to-end transmission of data between parties (with no middlemen). This is a big one: Nothing is being stored or copied in central servers. Moreover, ThreeFold’s self-driving and self-healing IT removes the need for human intervention and eliminates the many back doors present in current architecture. So, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;security issues&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; caused by human error and hacking possibilities both diminish greatly. In addition to that, there is the distributed storage algorithm which makes it nearly impossible for data to be lost. And much more. You can find more info on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or in this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#privacy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: privacy&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Privacy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;own your data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and nobody – not even us – can get access to it is key to making ThreeFold much more private than centralized cloud providers. On top of that, connections within our global overlay network, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, are peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the centralized cloud is quite expensive, whereas our ThreeFold P2P Cloud is much more cost-effective. Learn more about this in our cloud pricing comparison &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;threefold__cloud_pricing_compare&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While electricity for storing and transporting data, administration, human resources, and even gas (to transport physical data-holding devices) lead to a very high energy consumption, our dispersed storage model and peer-to-peer infrastructure allow for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_storage&quot;&gt;significant energy savings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. So, another big difference between ThreeFold and centralized cloud providers is that we’re up to 100x more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, the combination of our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers with their hyper-scale data centers. From decentralization and infinite scalability at the edge to considerable energy savings and cost effectiveness as well as data privacy and security, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;our solution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; has much more value to offer, while solving critical issues related to centralized clouds.

		<title>How ThreeFold Can Truly Decentralize Blockchain</title>
		<published>2021-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-10-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralize-blockchain/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/decentralize-blockchain/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The topic of decentralization is commonly tied to blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Blockchain doesn’t store any of its information in a central location, rather it is copied and spread across a network of computers. And the most popular name in the blockchain space, Bitcoin, was intended as an alternative payment system free of central control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many blockchains are facing the same challenge: How can they escape the monopolies of centralized cloud providers for their own workloads, as well as for the dApps built on top of them? The key question is, is a blockchain truly decentralized if it is being hosted on a centralized solution? We say: no.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example to illustrate this challenge is the fact that up to 60% of Ethereum (the world’s second most-popular blockchain) nodes run on centralized cloud providers and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;25% of them run on Amazon Web Services (AWS)&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the topic is being addressed, it isn’t being solved at scale. The good news is that ThreeFold can play a large part in solving it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-should-blockchains-make-this-move&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-blockchains-make-this-move&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-blockchains-make-this-move&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why should blockchains make this move?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blockchain movement, as mentioned, is very heavily tied to the movement around decentralization. Cryptocurrencies represent the move away from centralized banks as the authorities and gatekeepers around money – just as ThreeFold and similar projects represent the move away from centralized clouds as the authorities and gatekeepers around data. The thing is, if blockchains are to rely on centralized cloud for hosting, they aren’t truly embodying decentralization.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, many blockchains have chosen centralized cloud providers in the past because there wasn’t much of an alternative. But now, the Decentralized Cloud (DeCloud) movement has changed all of that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how some specific audiences can benefit:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-node-operators&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#for-node-operators&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: for-node-operators&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;For Node Operators&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any full node or validator node can run on ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, making that particular Blockchain even more community-owned, and more decentralized from an IT&#x2F;cloud level. Any node operator can choose to run their nodes from any farmer location on the ThreeFold Grid, totally &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what_is_peer_to_peer&#x2F;&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; between the chosen farmer and the node operator. The deployed workloads are computed in a P2P manner, no middle party involved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-dapp-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#for-dapp-developers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: for-dapp-developers&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;For dApp Developers&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web3&#x2F;Blockchain developers can use ThreeFold’s P2P Cloud - offering both compute and storage - to build and power their applications in a truly decentralized cloud infrastructure, both blockchain-native and cloud-native. A strong advantage here is that developers have the ability to leverage Kubernetes, Docker, S3, and other cloud-native tools (all compatible &#x2F; integrated with the ThreeFold) to power and optimize their data processing capabilities, as well as the overall functionality of their dApps. But the sweet spot is that it is deployed on a decentralized IT infrastructure, close to where users would be located.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-why-choose-threefold-over-other-decloud-projects&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#but-why-choose-threefold-over-other-decloud-projects&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: but-why-choose-threefold-over-other-decloud-projects&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;But why choose ThreeFold over other DeCloud projects?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be bigger names in the space, but ThreeFold’s technology and offerings are much more comprehensive than the rest. ThreeFold provides decentralized storage, compute, and network all under one roof (whereas most other projects offer only one of the three) and as mentioned, we have created an environment for developers which is highly-compatible to the developer tools and solutions they use today. Further, ThreeFold is building new infrastructure &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;from the ground up&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (rather than relying on extra space in data centers) and the technology is truly peer-to-peer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already have &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;partners&#x2F;blockchain&quot;&gt;a number of partners in the space&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; who recognize these advantages.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any blockchain protocol or dApp, whether operating DeFi, NFTs, DEXs, etc, will at some point need to leverage the power of the decentralized cloud and escape from centralized cloud providers. We’re seeing some of that adoption from a decentralized storage side with IPFS, which has been adopted by many dApps, and others – but as a developer, you will have to think twice, not just about where your&#x2F;your users’ data is being stored, but also about how (and where) your app is computed and powered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participate now in our quest to fully decentralize the Internet by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;becoming a node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on our grid or &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;buying TFT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the third stop on our journey that aims to better understand the space we operate in and how ThreeFold stands out. After exploring &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Dfinity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_2_akash&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I will now take a closer look at Filecoin to discover the similarities as well as differences of their project and ThreeFold. Let’s dive right in!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;filecoin-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#filecoin-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: filecoin-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Filecoin &amp;amp; how the project compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&quot;&gt;Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a global decentralized storage network and marketplace, founded in 2014 and based on the peer-to-peer protocol &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ipfs.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;IPFS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. The open-source project is one of the most popular providers of decentralized storage, with people storing files reliably on their mainnet. Like IPFS, Filecoin was founded by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protocol.ai&quot;&gt;Protocol Labs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ipfs.io&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;faq&#x2F;#ipfs-and-filecoin&quot;&gt;IPFS and Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are two separate but complementary open-source protocols. IPFS enables users to store, request, and transfer their data on Filecoin in a reliable way and directly from the IPFS network. As we deeply care about data security and privacy, I’d like to point out that IPFS &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.ipfs.io&#x2F;concepts&#x2F;privacy-and-encryption&#x2F;#what-s-public-on-ipfs&quot;&gt;does not provide a privacy layer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and that, subsequently, “all traffic on IPFS is public” – meaning there is no guarantee that your data would be stored privately and confidentially. At ThreeFold, we’re determined to provide a holistically &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;secure IT ecosystem&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with various secure and private &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;solutions&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, such as our Quantum Safe File System (&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;QSFS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;planetary-network&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, to empower users by giving them control and ownership of their data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filecoin provides a persistent data storage system and has built an incentive structure on top of the IPFS protocol to reward the provisioning of storage for other people’s data. The project offers a peer-to-peer &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;store&#x2F;#intro&quot;&gt;cloud storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; network and marketplace, offering an open market and reducing entry barriers to becoming a storage provider.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also offer a peer-to-peer network and cloud solution. Our ThreeFold Grid is the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;most advanced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; distributed peer-to-peer network there is, currently present in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&quot;&gt;more than 50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While Filecoin also has its own underlying blockchain, we’re the first full-stack blockchain-enabled cloud to be made open source. Moreover, we offer an energy-efficient &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;full stack cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that unites compute, storage, and network, and integrates all leading industry-standard tools – allowing for a seamless migration of any digital workload, even from &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;traditional cloud providers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; like Microsoft Azure or AWS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our cloud solution, developers are also enabled to deploy virtual machines or to discover the future of cloud computing with ZFlist, a game-changing Docker-compatible solution. As &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zflist&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is distributed across many mini virtual machines (VMs), it provides the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads on a highly secure level. On top of that, the data produced by these workloads can be stored in our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_pt2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (QSFS) solution. Our QSFS is highly compatible with most storage tools (e.g. S3) and protocols (e.g. IPFS). In addition to that, developers using our tech are enabled to set the terms for storing their workloads based on their needs – they even have the opportunity to scale their applications to the edge with powerful compute and storage capabilities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contributing and lending storage capacity on Filecoin’s marketplace, providers receive rewards, executed by Filecoin’s blockchain. However, providers can only participate in Filecoin’s market if their nodes are “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.filecoin.io&#x2F;about-filecoin&#x2F;what-is-filecoin&#x2F;#for-storage-providers&quot;&gt;built specifically for Filecoin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.” Actually, Filecoin nodes are IPFS nodes and their most advanced implementation is based on Lotus, the Filecoin Node Client. Our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;technology?id=_3nodes&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; have easy plug-and-play functionalities, allowing even people without technical skills to participate by getting a 3Node from one of our certified hardware partners and downloading our stateless and lightweight operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the driving force behind our Grid. 3Nodes can even be plugged in at your home. Filecoin, however, doesn’t seem to offer any kind of certified hardware.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we’ve built our own operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;zero_os_blog&#x2F;&quot;&gt;from scratch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, starting just with a Linux kernel, Filecoin doesn’t have its own OS. ThreeFold is not only more inclusive but also has a much higher scalability as anyone’s able to participate. In contrast, Filecoin even issues a warning in their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.filecoin.io&#x2F;mine&#x2F;&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which states that in order to run a successful mining operation, one has to meet high hardware requirements and to be highly familiar with Filecoin. Thanks to our autonomous, self-healing technology, no maintenance is required. To ensure the security of our 3Nodes can’t be accessed physically once booted. Therefore, our ThreeFold Grid is much more inclusive, as the network capacity on it is provided by many people and organizations constituting what we like to call “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;People’s Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.” Currently, we’re planning to extend our reach to enable even more people to join the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filecoin’s native token FIL and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT) are both utility tokens that fuel an open-source cloud. The earning model for FIL follows a simple logic for earning: the more storage a miner adds, the more FIL the respective miner will be rewarded with while also receiving FIL from users leasing their storage capacity. However, Filecoin miners must stake their FIL and can even lose their stake if their node does not perform, whereas our farming model doesn’t require staking, so farmers don’t risk losing their funds. In addition to that, our ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) can represent either a unit of compute, storage or network on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and our farmers are rewarded for connecting one of these types of capacity to our Grid. Moreover, we’ll soon implement a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;new discount model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, providing users with discounted capacity pricings based on the amount of ThreeFold Tokens stored in a user’s wallet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Filecoin’s model, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.filecoin.io&#x2F;mine&#x2F;how-mining-works&#x2F;&quot;&gt;mining&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; means contributing storage capacity to be leased by users on the marketplace that are looking to store their data. Currently, Filecoin has two types of miners – storage miners, who are responsible for storing data, and retrieval miners, who are responsible for the fast retrieval of files. A retrieval miner’s “ability to close retrieval deals” are determined by the miner’s respective bandwidth and response time. ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro&quot;&gt;farming&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is the concept of expanding the Internet with more network, compute, and storage capacity. Farmers are &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;farming&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;rewarded&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; income in the form of TFTs for providing internet capacity. Moreover, anyone can become a farmer, as farmers are independent from ThreeFold. There’s no technical knowledge is required to connect to our global peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure and all it takes is network bandwidth and electricity, in addition to our 3Node – without the interference of any type of intermediary. Therefore, a ThreeFold Farmer is ThreeFold’s more sustainable equivalent of the miners of other cryptocurrencies, disrupting the centralized data center model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the two projects share the same vision of bringing users’ data closer to their respective owners, establishing an open cloud market that is independent from the few big centralized cloud providers currently dominating the market. Like ThreeFold, Filecoin seeks to provide a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;store&#x2F;#flexible&quot;&gt;network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; built as well as owned by the people, regardless of their location. Nevertheless, Filecoin is focused on storage and mainly based on the IPFS protocol, only providing an incentive layer on top. In contrast, ThreeFold provides &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;all three&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; major low-level components of the internet’s backbone: compute, storage and network. Additionally, ThreeFold’s P2P Cloud offers a holistic set of solutions – from our Planetary Network and our Quantum Safe File System to our eVDC and marketplace. All in all, the technology and infrastructure we’re providing is turning traditional IT upside down.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why ThreeFold is the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;ideal substrate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for projects like Filecoin to run on, as we’re already IPFS-compatible and provide the low-level primitives for a fully decentralized cloud. So, we believe Filecoin and ThreeFold could team up to jointly drive the decentralization of cloud. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their website, Filecoin &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;filecoin.io&#x2F;build&#x2F;#community&quot;&gt;states&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that they’re all about “coming together to collaborate and build something greater,” so they seem open to collaboration – which is very appealing to us, as we truly believe in collaboration to effect change at a large scale to fully decentralize the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;Internet and Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Thanks for continuing this journey with me and don’t forget to stay tuned for the next stop: Storj!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As announced in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;the first episode of this series&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I’d like to shed some light on the complex decentralization and blockchain space and look into what fellow projects have to offer. There are various projects decentralizing parts of the internet. So in this second blog post, we’ll be exploring Akash and their solutions to find out what we have in common and where we differ. Follow me on the second step of my journey to better understand the space we operate in and how ThreeFold stands out.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;akash-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#akash-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: akash-how-the-project-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Akash &amp;amp; how the project compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 2015, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akash.network&quot;&gt;Akash&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is an open-source and blockchain-based cloud computing platform. They &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akash.network&#x2F;about#vision&quot;&gt;strive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for an open, permissionless, and sovereign cloud that allows anyone to reserve computing resources without any intermediaries. Their cloud platform provides a simple way for deploying and scaling cloud applications. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Akash Network is a decentralized, on-chain marketplace for leasing cloud computing resources, while the Akash Container Platform is an off-chain platform for cloud management services (deployment, hosting, and management of workloads) on Kubernetes, the industry standard for container orchestration. We also integrated Kubernetes into our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;cloud#&#x2F;cloud__cloud_intro&quot;&gt;P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solution, but we didn’t stop there. On ThreeFold’s cloud solution, developers additionally have the option to deploy virtual machines or to discover the future of cloud computing with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zflist&quot;&gt;ZFlist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; – a game-changing Docker-compatible solution that is distributed across many mini VMs, positioning itself as the ideal infrastructure for edge workloads. And all data produced by these workloads can be stored in our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; solution that is highly compatible with most storage tools (e.g. S3) and protocols (e.g. IPFS).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Akash, developers would get access to what is probably the best decentralized computing cloud on the market, whereas ThreeFold offers a full stack cloud infrastructure that unites compute, storage, and network. Having integrated all leading industry-standard tools, ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;cloud solution&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; allows for a seamless migration of any digital workload – even from centralized cloud providers like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;AWS or Microsoft Azure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This empowers developers from all over the world to deploy their applications and workloads on a fully decentralized infrastructure, without having to learn new tools. Developers using Akash, however, may still need to rely on other decentralized projects to decentralize the storage and network components of their solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akash sees their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.akash.network&quot;&gt;USP&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in hosting containers that allow any type of cloud-native application to be hosted without vendor lock-in or having to learn new protocols, a vision shared and extended by ThreeFold as the project is already compatible with most of the industry standards. With the integration of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-grid-3-0-supports-terraform&#x2F;1184&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; into the upcoming third release of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, developers will be capable of hosting any existing or future Linux workload seamlessly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-and-development-possibilities&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#network-and-development-possibilities&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: network-and-development-possibilities&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Network and development possibilities&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akash is one of the most robust decentralized compute solutions out there and is one of the key players in driving the DeCloud movement. On its platform, computing resources can be leased on the Akash Marketplace, driven by its blockchain based on the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cosmos&#x2F;cosmos-sdk&quot;&gt;Cosmos SDK&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It’s already being used by a range of blockchains and applications. On their marketplace, users can determine the terms and price for their deployments and have cloud providers bid for the opportunity in a reversed auction. Nevertheless, the project still relies on centralized data centers as they seek to prevent unutilized capacity &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.orchid.com&#x2F;akash-networks-greg-osuri-on-decentralizing-cloud-computing&#x2F;&quot;&gt;from centralized cloud computing services&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to go to waste, leveraging about 85% of this underutilized cloud capacity from data centers. So, while Akash is preventing capacity from being wasted, they also highly depend on centralized capacity – and so do the workloads using their platform.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ThreeFold, developers are enabled to tailor the terms for storing their workloads to fit their needs, benefiting from full decentralization and edge possibilities. Moreover, developers get access to the most distributed peer-to-peer infrastructure in the world – the ThreeFold, currently present in &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;explorer.grid.tf&quot;&gt;more than 50 countries&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Another unique attribute of the ThreeFold Grid is that the capacity within the network is provided by many people and organizations, forming an infrastructure that can be described as the “&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;People’s Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.” It is the first full-stack blockchain-enabled cloud to be made open source, allowing anyone to connect cloud capacity to the network by downloading &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, our stateless and lightweight operating system powering the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Once booted, the servers run and can’t be accessed physically. As they’re self-healing, they don’t require any maintenance. All in all, this model flips traditional IT upside down, allowing anyone to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;join&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the ThreeFold ecosystem. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects also reward their communities for providing capacity. Akash planned to launch a limited edition for an own node device, called Supermini, with plug-and-play functionalities similar to our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;technology&#x2F;technology?id=_3nodes&quot;&gt;3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;However, Akash &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;akash.network&#x2F;blog&#x2F;supermini-update&quot;&gt;just announced&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that they’ll be postponing the launch of their Supermini indefinitely, meaning they won’t be offering anything comparable to our 3Node anytime soon.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; Our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a general purpose computer that acts as  a low-level provider for IT capacity. It is booted with our unique operating system Zero-OS and enables even people without technical skills to participate. We’re collaborating with certified hardware partners and plan to extend our reach in the near future to allow even more people to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;join&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; the ThreeFold Grid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;tokenomics-and-incentive-models&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#tokenomics-and-incentive-models&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: tokenomics-and-incentive-models&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Tokenomics and incentive models&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, Akash Token (AKT) and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tft&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Token&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TFT), are utility tokens fuelling an open-source cloud. While the Akash Tokens (AKT) represent a unit of compute on the Akash Network, ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) represent a unit of compute, storage or network on the ThreeFold Grid. Akash’s payment model allows users to pay for what they need, when they need it, using a reverse auction. In order to create a deployment, users have to provide a deposit first. As payments are effected passively, it is crucial for users to keep their deposits funded to maintain the lease of their capacity reservations. With our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;tf-chain&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Blockchain&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, which will be released on Testnet 3.0 soon, a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;introducing-tf-chain-an-updated-billing-model&#x2F;1277&quot;&gt;new billing model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is being introduced. This model allows users to authorize &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;smart-contract&quot;&gt;smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to automatically deduct their wallets (similarly to a direct debit transaction), depending on how much capacity they use. Additionally, we’re implementing a new discount model, which will provide users with discounted capacity pricings according to the amount of ThreeFold Tokens stored in a user’s wallet.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, Akash does a great job with regards to decentralizing cloud capacity. However, it doesn’t challenge the status-quo in terms of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;data privacy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. At ThreeFold, we’re determined to empower users, to give them back control and ownership of their data in an &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;entirely secure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, peer-to-peer IT ecosystem. While Akash and ThreeFold seem like competitors on a cloud level, we see ourselves more as a potential &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;decentralized substrate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for Akash to scale to the edges of our world. Akash developers would surely benefit from the lightweight and stateless features of our Zero-OS which could provide them with a more efficient and private infrastructure to test, build, and collaborate on workloads. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akash and ThreeFold share the same goal – to bring secure, performant, and data-sovereign cloud solutions for humanity to thrive. As Sam &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;threefold-is-the-substrate-for-decloud&#x2F;1295&quot;&gt;put in a nutshell&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;: ThreeFold is the ideal substrate for projects like Akash to run on, instead of depending on traditional cloud providers – as we provide the low-level primitives for a decentralized world. So, we believe &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-is-threefold-different-from-akash-and-holochain&#x2F;804&#x2F;2&quot;&gt;Akash and ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; are complementary in many ways and could  join forces to further push the boundaries of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;africa.businessinsider.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;markets&#x2F;ambitious-startup-to-disrupt-the-internet-and-cloud&#x2F;b38rwj4&quot;&gt;cloud decentralization&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; together.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we truly believe in collaboration, we invite all other projects in the space to join us in our quest to decentralize the entire Internet and Cloud stack to restore the neutrality we once took for granted.

		<title>Building a New Internet From the Ground Up – Part 3: Compute</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome back for another installment of our accessible series on ThreeFold Grid technology. We are working through the three major     categories that make up cloud infrastructure: storage, compute, and network. This time, we’ll be focusing on compute.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-compute&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-compute&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-compute&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is compute?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building_a_new_internet_from_the_ground_up_pt2&#x2F;&quot;&gt;storage&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and network are fairly intuitive concepts – where data lives and how it gets around – compute is about the more mysterious realm of data processing and ultimately computer programming. Don’t worry though, you don’t need any technical abilities to gain a deeper understanding of what’s happening behind the scenes when we use apps or interact with web sites.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;first part&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of this series, compute is basically what happens with data once it reaches its destination. Compute gives data relevance, by processing it according to the instructions provided by developers in their source code. When talking about what the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; offers in terms of compute, it’s mostly about how the code that developers produce gets executed in order to provide the services we enjoy. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ThreeFold, this actually happens for the most part using the same tools and systems provided by traditional cloud services, meaning that it’s highly compatible with existing cloud applications. What really makes the Grid different is that it’s been designed to provide a level of efficiency and security that simply isn’t possible without starting “from the ground up”. Before we get into specifics of compute offerings built into ThreeFold’s &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, let’s briefly explore what computing is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;playing-with-zeroes-and-ones&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#playing-with-zeroes-and-ones&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: playing-with-zeroes-and-ones&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Playing with zeroes and ones&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything a computer’s central processing unit does is based on a limited set of instructions that includes basic mathematical functions, logical operations, and ways to control the flow of a program. At their core, computers are really just automated adding machines that execute specified operations on whatever input they receive. It may be hard to believe that simple math creates all of the vibrant digital experience we enjoy, but at a certain low level, that’s the truth.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a messaging app as an example. Within a computer, all of the text, emojis, and images we see are represented by numbers. When we search for some text within a chat, matches are determined by checking if the numbers corresponding to the words we typed are equal to some numbers corresponding to words that appear in the chat history. This information is then converted into the list of results we see on screen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this context, compute is mostly responsible for organizing all of our messages based on the individual or group we were talking with, the time that the message happened, and whether or not we’ve opened it yet. Typically, a messaging app stores data both on our local devices and on a back end in the cloud. Compute is also how the service decides to copy messages you sent on one device to other devices where you have the same app installed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an important distinction about how the ThreeFold Grid operates. In a traditional cloud environment, it is impossible to know for sure what is happening on the backend, even if you are the one running the service. The administrative access retained by the cloud provider can be used for surveillance and tampering that can be very difficult or impossible to detect. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero OS offers a unique assurance that no one can abuse the Grid in this way, because it operates autonomously with no facilities provided for human intervention. In order to utilize compute capacity on the Grid, individuals and organizations deploy their choice of several “primitives,” or basic components, that provide an environment for code to be executed and create the magic we experience as online applications.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-compute-primitives&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-compute-primitives&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-compute-primitives&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold Compute Primitives&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we’re getting a bit into the technical weeds here, we’ll just take a brief look at each primitive and what makes it special.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;zmachine&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zmachine&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zmachine&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zmachine&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zmachine is a lightweight virtual machine (VM) implementation that’s been developed in a uniquely efficient way by ThreeFold. VMs are essentially computers within computers, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical system. A common example is running the Windows operating system on a Mac that’s already running MacOS. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cloud world, virtual machines are a classic way to manage complex deployments with flexibility and resilience – by packaging different components into different VMs that can be run side by side and moved between different physical servers with ease. While VMs have been replaced in many cases with the new container paradigm, which we’ll cover next, they are still widely used and provide a simpler solution than containers that’s sufficient for many use cases.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;flist&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#flist&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: flist&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Flist&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F;zflist&quot;&gt;Flist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;  is a next generation container format which extends the industry standard Docker container concept in an efficient and secure way. It is supported directly at the operating system level on Zero OS, and in its latest version on ThreeFold Grid 3.0, provides a unique advantage over traditional containers via the use of mini virtual machines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers provide greater efficiency and flexibility than VMs, by sharing parts of the host operating system between containers rather than duplicating the full operating system for each component. This, however, means that containers typically come with less of an assurance that different workloads and their data remain isolated from each other. By employing mini VMs, the Flist concept provides better isolation than traditional container systems while retaining the advantages that containers offer over full VMs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;kubernetes&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#kubernetes&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: kubernetes&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Kubernetes&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers usually represent small parts of a full solution, which are created, interconnected, and destroyed on an ongoing basis. Kubernetes is the industry standard container orchestration system, and it’s used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments. Kubernetes solutions are defined through configuration files that specify the types of containers, how updates are handled, and the network architecture both between containers and with the outside world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple physical servers or VMs are typically used for a Kubernetes “cluster” which provides redundancy and scalability. The ThreeFold Grid provides a lightweight Kubernetes VM that can be used to create clusters according to specific needs. Kubernetes users can, for the most part, simply bring their existing configuration files and recreate their deployments on a Grid based cluster seamlessly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrapping-up&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#wrapping-up&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: wrapping-up&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Wrapping up&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the compute primitives offer a comprehensive alternative to existing cloud compute providers. Users of Docker, Kubernetes, and virtual machines can bring their deployments to the Grid with a minimal amount of migration effort. This is distinct from other decentralized cloud projects, which either offer a single solution like Kubernetes or a completely new environment that developers must adapt their code to run within.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better yet, each compute offering on the ThreeFold Grid benefits from the unique efficiency and security features of Zero OS, as well as the unique aspects of the primitives themselves. Thanks again for joining me on this journey into the wonderful world of ThreeFold technology. In the next episode, we’ll cover the last element of the cloud infrastructure triad: network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>A Journey through the Decentralization and Blockchain Space – Part One: Dfinity</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re new to ThreeFold or have been around for a while, the decentralization and blockchain space can often be quite elusive and opaque with regards to what certain projects have to offer. Very clear, however, is the current market cap for aggregated decentralized compute and storage projects which exceeds 50 billion USD. Therefore, we decided to shed some light on the space and to show you how our solutions compare to those of other projects.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is the first one in a series to explore fellow projects and their solutions with regards to what they share with ThreeFold but also where we differ. Follow me on my journey through the decentralization and blockchain space to get a better understanding of where we are within the space. First up: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;a-journey-through-the-decentralization-and-blockchain-space-part-one-dfinity&#x2F;1316&quot;&gt;Dfinity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dfinity-foundation-how-it-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-dfinity-foundation-how-it-compares-to-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-dfinity-foundation-how-it-compares-to-threefold&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The DFINITY Foundation &amp;amp; how it compares to ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dfinity.org&#x2F;foundation&quot;&gt;DFINITY Foundation&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a not-for-profit organization, founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams and headquartered in Zürich, Switzerland. With a team of more than 200 people, Dfinity is developing the technology for the Internet Computer blockchain. It seeks to free the Internet from big tech and monopolization and return to the Internet’s open roots by offering a public blockchain on which systems and dApps can be rebuilt in a secure and scalable way.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the term “rebuild” already indicates, Dfinity’s own SDK has to be used to build on their platform, whereas ThreeFold is highly compatible with industry standards tools and protocols (e.g. Linux-based workloads, S3, Docker containers, Kubernetes). This allows for existing applications to be easily migrated onto the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, while also offering unparalleled levels of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;security&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, privacy and decentralization. Moreover, Dfinity’s architecture is blockchain-based and offers a platform for dApps, while ThreeFold is based on its own operating system, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and is a platform for P2P network, storage and compute. The ThreeFold Grid uses a blockchain internally only where it is truly needed while also offering the missing capacity layer which enables every blockchain to become &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;decentralize_blockchain&#x2F;&quot;&gt;truly decentralized&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another difference is that Dfinity is more about creating an ecosystem of independent data centers, whereas ThreeFold turns the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_cloud_vs_centralized_providers_like_aws_azure&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data center model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; upside down by enabling anyone to become a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.threefold.tech&#x2F;index.php?route=common&#x2F;home&quot;&gt;node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; of the system. Even non-technical people can &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;join the network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play offerings through ThreeFold’s certified hardware partners. The ThreeFold Grid is therefore &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;more inclusive&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and allows individuals to participate as well, which enables ThreeFold to scale an unlimited number of nodes, whereas Dfinity currently uses a limited set of existing data centers. The question remains of whether they will incentivise an easier way into their system. ThreeFold’s model is not only infinitely scalable but also can act as the ideal substrate for edge computing which is difficult for Dfinity to achieve with its more centralized structure. Also, Threefold’s self-driving and self-healing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&quot;&gt;technology&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is unique in the space and removes the pain of having to monitor and maintain the nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, ThreeFold’s Zero-OS was created from scratch and its low-level design allows it to achieve unparalleled levels of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;security&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and decentralization. With VMs, Kubernetes, a next-generation container environment, and the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zdbfs&quot;&gt;Quantum Safe File System&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, ThreeFold’s offering is much more comprehensive than Dfinity’s canister offering. A potential collaboration, however, could be beneficial for Dfinity. By hosting their offerings on the ThreeFold Grid, Dfinity could benefit from ThreeFold’s fully decentralized and autonomous infrastructure.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Conclusion&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both, Dfinity and ThreeFold, share the same ambition to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tgdaily.com&#x2F;web&#x2F;6-dfinity-threefold-are-leading-an-internet-decentralization-revolution&#x2F;&quot;&gt;revolutionize the Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. While both provide a platform for dApps to be built upon, ThreeFold has a much more comprehensive and compatible stack. Therefore, Dfinity could benefit from moving to the ThreeFold Grid as an underlying &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnkoetsier&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;20&#x2F;largest-distributed-peer-to-peer-grid-on-the-planet-laying-foundation-for-a-decentralized-internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, rather than depending on their more centralized data center structure. In addition to that, their data center operators could also choose to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;become farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the ThreeFold Grid, while continuing to host Dfinity – without having to worry about system administration and maintenance as ThreeFold’s technology is fully self-healing. In that way they could finally run on a fully decentralized, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and self-healing infrastructure – and as Dfinity &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dfinity.org&#x2F;foundation&quot;&gt;stated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, they’re “committed to connecting those who believe the same”, so we hope to find the spirit of decentralization and collaboration in our future engagements.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>Interview – Designing Solutions for a P2P Future</title>
		<published>2021-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-08-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/interview-with-jimber/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/interview-with-jimber/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, I met with Jonas Delrue from Jimber, the team developing P2P solutions like video chat, office workspace, isolated web browser, and messaging, using the Digital Twin platform. Digital Twin is a use case on top of the ThreeFold Grid. We talked about the technical hurdles and motivations for developing private, decentralized, and open source alternatives to popular products from major corporations.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The following has been edited lightly for clarity and flow.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I’m wondering about this video chat solution that we’re using for the interview right now. Building reliable video conferencing took a long time for the industry to get right, as far as I understand, and this seems very comparable in performance to Zoom. What did it take to produce this, what challenges came up, and what open source components are you using?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yes, the solution is fully open source, using Janus as a back end which is a signaling and MTU server that handles all the traffic. But the main reason why we created our own solution is because we want to deploy the solution on the ThreeFold Grid and make a really decentralized video application. So everyone can start their own video room and the data will only be shared between the members of the room, instead of going through Zoom.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The reasons for this have become very clear in the latest developments at Zoom where they had the lawsuits for end-to-end encryption. So something that our solution will offer is not only end-to-end encryption but also the traffic won’t go through central points – so there’s no way for us to eavesdrop on any of the conversations as a company since we’re not included in the process. So that’s the main reason that we created this one.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Very cool. I know for Zoom free accounts, all traffic is routed through servers in the United States which also has performance implications for anyone in other parts of the world. You have this big transatlantic hop back and forth for people talking to each other in different parts of Europe, for example, which could create lag or dropouts. And of course, the privacy feature is super important, because if we’re using Zoom or any other centralized service it’s a black box. They say your connections are end-to-end encrypted, but there’s no way to verify that without open source code and self hosting.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yep, so what we offer is fully open source, and using the Digital Twin platform you’ll be able to start your own solutions, so it’s fully in your own hands.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Do you know what kind of resources are required to run the video chat server?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The CPU and memory usage on the server is very low, but bit rate depends on how good your connection is and how high quality you want to use. Right now we have some default quality but we will be able to make that configurable, so you’ll be able to choose how much data that you want to consume during your conversation, which will of course imply a better or a worse resolution and experience.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Totally. I’ve heard that we should be able to host many Digital Twins on a single node. I’m curious of your thoughts on that. How many Digital Twins do you think we could run on a single Titan node or server in a rack?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;That’s a hard one. I’d have to check for real numbers on the current implementation, but the thing is that there’s not really a hard limit, as long as you keep improving your software and making it more efficient, making it more suitable to the scaling case. Right now in centralized systems this mostly is not a concern, but if you make it more suitable to self hosting and the digital twin scenario, then we should be able to get really far on that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s going to take some effort and time to improve it and to make it better so the usage goes down, while the hardware also gets better so it’s two ways. I think in the long run we should be able to host really lots and lots of Digital Twins on one single node. It also depends on what you’re doing on the Digital Twins, if everyone is doing video conversations it will of course have more consumption than if everyone is just chatting in text.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
There’s a good number of features here in video chat already like the background replace and some others I was impressed to see already during my testing. Of course Zoom has many more features like hosting these large conferences, breakout groups, allowing people to raise their hand digitally. I’m wondering what features are on the road map for this solution and what should we expect to see coming next?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Raising hands is one of the things that we’re developing now, but we’re mostly doing improvements at the back end so we can get a more efficient solution and a solution that is better suited to the decentralized way of working. Now, we don’t have the size of team that Zoom has of course at this point, so we’re a bit slower in releasing new features. We do have a list of things that we want to implement in the near future. Things like waiting rooms and all the stuff that you came up with, they’re on the road map but not for the very short term since right now we’re really focusing on getting this thing working in a decentralized way on the Grid.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That makes sense. And what is the status of that? Are we using the Grid right now, or is this a staging server?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is a production server of Jimber. We use this one to talk to our employees, so for internal calls, and we’re also using it to talk to clients. We’ve been using it for over six months without any problems so it’s really production ready, but this version is not running on the Grid right now. We do have deployments on the Grid that work perfectly.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Good to know. Is that something that someone with the proper amount of knowledge and motivation could test for themselves already, running the solution on the Grid?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, they should be able to. It might be that they still need a little bit of help from the technical team, but it should be doable, yes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Cool, I’ll put that on my list of things to try out. So that’s video chat. Do you see any challenges arising from quirks of the Grid in implementing any features or scaling things up to a certain level. Is there anything that’s tricky about moving something like this onto the Grid?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s more about the Digital Twin than the meeting solution itself. Right now we’re really working on getting the Digital Twin able to launch for a single person, so we’re checking out how we’ll do the deployments, the payment flow, things like that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So for us, that’s the challenge right now, but in the long run it’s probably going to be scaling, being sure that the Digital Twin runs close enough to the person actually using it, being sure that the interaction between Digital Twins is really fast and with low latency. Things like that will of course be a huge challenge, and also keeping everything private, making sure that everything is secure is also a bit challenging.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Another big challenge is that users are not used to a decentralized environment. So if you lose your seed phrase or in some way destroy your own Digital Twin, it’s decentralized so we can’t access it. There isn’t a company that can just look into the big system and fix it for you. You are a bit responsible for your own system so that’s also a bit of a challenge. So to get users informed and make software that’s really easy for them, where they can’t mess things up, and where users can give us enough logs when something goes wrong to help them in a decentralized way.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
For sure, I know that’s a big concern around our VDC solution as well. You onboard someone into the system and they need to take responsibility for their own data and deployments. I think that’s a huge issue across this space right, you want to give people the power but they also need to be able to take the responsibility. We’ll see how that goes, as users start to come onboard and what kinds of challenges they run into.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, that’s going to be the fun part, once users really start onboarding and start using everything. It’s mostly a stressful situation at first if you launch a new product, but we’re going to be starting off with a beta version so we don’t get too much ahead of ourselves. Using the beta period to really get the software to be at the point where we need it for production will probably be the best step, to take the stress a bit off the team, and in the next version we can go full fledged production with a really nice product.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
How soon do you think we’ll be ready to invite some members of the community to start testing?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We want to have a version ready for September, so that’s what we’re looking at.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Great. Let’s shift gears and talk about the file browser and office solution, which I’ve also tested. It’s very cool. You’re able to preview images and videos, edit documents, and more. I understand it’s at least two open source components, you have the file browser and OnlyOffice working together.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;So the file browser is totally made by us, it’s fully new. We use OnlyOffice as a document service to edit the documents, and right now you can already share documents with other people and collaborate on documents. We’re building a kind of online office alternative that is owned by you and where your files are safe from companies trying to get data from it to give you specific advertisements and that sort of thing.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Okay, I didn’t realize that the file browser piece had been built in house.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s still very basic. It doesn’t have all the features of the big ones yet. It has the basic functionality—you can upload files, make folders, put the files in the folders, open files, collaborate, save them, share with people, all of those things are available, so it’s pretty usable. This has been launched in a staging version right now, so it’s not available to the full public yet but it should be available in September when we launch the first Digital Twin version.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I’ve tested it, and it works really well. I’m curious again—obviously building something like this isn’t a small task. Building an alternative to products from massive corporations with huge budgets and teams. So for your team, what are the challenges and how did you make this work?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Of course using open source components like OnlyOffice is a big difference. It’d be hard to make all of the documents services ourselves—that would be really insane. So using open source components is a big key factor in this, but a second thing is that our team has been building and trying out stuff like this for a few years so we do have some experience in building these kinds of tools.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So in Digital Twin we also have the chat solution. Is there anything about chat that’s cool or unique?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We’re looking at the big modern chat applications for our ideas there, as well as adding some new stuff in it. For the most part you have all the features that you need. You can send text messages and audio streams. You can send GIFs, which is of course the most important feature in any chat application. Then there’s, block users, delete users, add users to make group conversations, share files with the whole group, all the things like that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Does that mean that we should be able to switch from Telegram sometime in the near future?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I hope so yeah, it would be really cool when we can do that. The biggest difference of course is the underlying decentralized architecture.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So finally, to wrap up, maybe you could talk a bit about how privacy and security is handled? We have end-to-end encryption, we have self hosting of data. What does that look like and how is it built?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In terms of the platform itself, that’s something that the ThreeFold core team is more working on, so I know the principles and know how it works but I can’t give you real technical details. As for what we build, the biggest tool that we use right now for end-to-end encryption is Yggdrasil or the Planetary Network, as we refer to it in ThreeFold. So that’s a technology where multiple computers form one grid and they can exchange messages with each other which are fully end-to-end encrypted, using the standard TCP stack of those nodes. In that way we can communicate between Digital Twins in a very easy way, using standard technology, but just changing the underlying network architecture.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Totally, I know a bit about Yggdrasil. I haven’t had a chance to test it myself, but it’s super exciting technology, right? It allows anyone behind a firewall to still have a public address where they can still be reachable on IPv6 and everything is encrypted.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;And as soon as you’re connected to one node, you’re connected to every one of them, because they all forward the packets, all end to end encrypted. So it’s a really cool technology.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Absolutely, and it’s great to be able to build on this kind of stuff. Like you’re saying, the open source components give us a big head start in trying to build these alternatives.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Indeed.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Is there anything else you’d like to say about what you all have been building over there?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The whole ride has been really cool, we’re kind of working on a few things at once, and ThreeFold is one of the components of it. For us it’s a very exciting project, it’s very technical and building something entirely new that doesn’t exist yet using all these open source components. So for the team it’s a very cool challenge, we really like to work on it, and it drives the team to create something really cool. It’s a great opportunity.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I love that, and it’s a big reason I’m excited to be involved with ThreeFold as well: building something that’s totally new, going from 0 to 1, and then inviting the world to come check it out and enjoy all the benefits.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Oh yeah, I forgot to ask about the web browser. I understand that Jimber has been building this for a while and I’ve seen some things about this on your website. So the web browser solution essentially renders the webpage on the back end and just shows the user an image of it?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yeah, it caches the page on the back end and forwards the data to the client where it’s rendered. So the code of the website itself doesn’t reach you, and that’s a solution that we use for multiple things. One is to protect APIs from getting attacked by users, what we call web application isolation. The second use case is where we have an office environment where people browse the internet and they use our solution to kind of make a gap between the computer in the company and the internet itself. But they can still browse the web and use all their favorite tools without having the risk of getting viruses and things like that.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I didn’t realize that there’s benefit on the server end as well. So by requiring users to interact with a web service through the browser solution, that provides isolation for the app as well?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If users are going to the service they are going through our browser, which will fetch the service for you and just give you a state of how it looks so that way we can really protect the back end of the applications from multiple attacks.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And does this effectively provide a VPN for users as well?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s kind of the same thing, yes.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That’s super exciting. Something that folks ask me about when they learn about ThreeFold is hosting VPNs on the Grid as a way to get the benefits of VPN in a decentralized way.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yggdrasil is a bit closer to a VPN than our browser itself, but they pretty much help each other out. The browser in the ThreeFold network is used to protect the Digital Twin itself, to make it very secure and private for you, but the browser can also be used to browse websites from any country in the world without restrictions. So it can be used in that way too, which is kind of similar to how people at home use VPNs.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That’s good to know. Well, I really like the bigger picture here of an internet experience that’s end-to-end encrypted, where all of your data is under your control, and you have the anonymity and privacy that a VPN would provide. It’s very exciting stuff, and I’m looking forward to sharing about it with our larger community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Building a New Internet From the Ground Up – Part 2: Storage</title>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/building-a-new-internet-from-the-ground-up/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome back for the second part of this introductory series on ThreeFold Grid technology. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;an_intro_to_the_threefold_grid&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Last time&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; we took a high level view of all that the Grid offers. This time, we’ll be zooming in on storage, covering the low level components and how they can provide a familiar experience like the cloud “drives” and “boxes” we use today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold Grid offers several different storage primitives that can be combined in various ways to meet the needs of developers and end users of Grid capacity. Ultimately, all storage services are a way of presenting the underlying hardware to software workloads in various ways, according to the desired features. ThreeFold has created a few unique storage offerings, providing distinct benefits over legacy cloud infrastructure. From the start, every component has been designed for optimal efficiency and they work together to offer an unprecedented level of security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our most basic storage primitive is a “volume”, which simply offers some disk space to an application in a generic way. We’ll focus more on the innovative solutions that are built on the Zero Database, or Zdb. These are compatible with existing use cases but also represent a quantum leap forward for privacy and security. They are called Zdbfs, Zstor, and QSFS. Let’s take a look at each component and how they work together to provide a complete set of tools for developers building on the Grid. We’ll also see why this matters to end users of services that are hosted on the Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zdb&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zdb&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zdb&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zdb&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zdb is a low level offering that implements with a subset of features from the popular Redis protocol. It is a key-value store, which means that information is indexed like a dictionary. Each “word” in the database is associated with a “definition” or piece of data. Zdb is super fast and efficient, along with operating in an “append only” manner. This means that all new data is added to empty space following the end of existing data, never overwritten. It’s like writing in pen on paper without leaving any white space.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Append only has many advantages, including extending the life of certain hardware and offering archiving features out of the box. The disadvantage, of course, is that old data is retained even when no longer needed. However, this can be addressed by periodically “compacting” the data, to remove what’s no longer needed and restructure what remains with the same level of efficiency. We use Zdb as a base layer for more complex storage implementations that benefit from these features.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zdbfs&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zdbfs&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zdbfs&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zdbfs&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Zdb has all of those neat properties, it requires that applications utilize a specific database interface. To expand its capabilities, we have the Zdb Filesystem. With Zdbfs, the back end Zdb is exposed through the most common interface used for storing and retrieving data: a filesystem. This is the same format we’re all familiar with from the file explorers on our computers. When running Zdbfs, a new “folder” appears on the system, allowing reading and writing to the connected Zdb without any concern for the underlying database. With Zdbfs, nearly all existing tools for working with data can be plugged in to and benefit from the advantages of Zdb.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zstor&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zstor&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zstor&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zstor&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been discussing solutions that utilize storage space on a single node only. While this offers flexibility for developers with a variety of needs, it is also limited in the sense that the failure of a single node would result in the loss of all data. With that in mind, we offer the Zstor solution for spreading data across multiple nodes in a way that provides both resilience against failures and unprecedented security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Zstor takes a single file as input, to be stored among a number of nodes as specified in its configuration. The system is flexible and able to cater to different needs for performance, redundancy, and geographical distribution. Understanding what happens behind the scenes requires a little math, but I’ll provide as simple an explanation as I can. Zstor has a very unique property: it does not actually upload any of the user’s data to the back end nodes, but it is able to reconstruct the data later based on the descriptive information that is stored.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-magic-of-erasure-encoding&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-magic-of-erasure-encoding&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-magic-of-erasure-encoding&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The magic of erasure encoding&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like magic? Well, let’s explore briefly how this is possible. Zstor relies on a technology known as erasure encoding, which was originally designed to protect data against errors that sometimes occur in the normal operation of computer hardware. Rather than simply making copies of the data as backups, a clever scheme is used to efficiently offer the same benefit. With basic redundancy, four extra copies would be needed to accommodate four failures without a loss of data. Erasure encoding can accomplish the same failure tolerance using less than half the space needed for the original data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While erasure encoding can be implemented by storing the data itself along with some extra data known as “parity”, it can also be implemented without storing the original data at all. As a simplified example, let’s say that we want to store the number 13. First, we take each digit individually, 1 and 3. Next, we calculate 1 + 3 = 4 and 3 - 1 = 2. By storing 4 and 2, along with the instructions to reverse these calculations, we have everything needed to get back to 13. If we add one more equation, say 1 - 3 = -2, we can restore the original data using any two of the numbers we’ve computed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Each of our values would be stored on separate nodes, while the instructions to recombine them would be stored in yet another location. If an attacker were to compromise one of these nodes, they would only have a number that’s meaningless without the other elements. If a single node fails, the original data can be restored using the remaining nodes, and we can add a new node to bring us back to our desired state. By tuning these values, additional security or redundancy can be achieved. We might decide that we want 9 of 10 values to be present for reconstruction, representing a high level of security. Alternatively, a 2 of 10 arrangement would provide high redundancy, tolerating the failure of 8 nodes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;quantum-safe-filesystem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#quantum-safe-filesystem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: quantum-safe-filesystem&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Quantum Safe Filesystem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these components working together, we have ThreeFold’s flagship storage solution, the Quantum Safe Filesystem or QSFS. It uses Zstor to backup data written to a Zdbfs. This provides the convenient and highly compatible filesystem interface along with the exceptional security and redundancy benefits of Zstor. We call it quantum safe, because even an attacker with a quantum computer would not be able to decode users’ data, if they managed to hack into one of the back end nodes—already an extraordinary feat given the exceptional security of Zero OS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-it-home&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bringing-it-home&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bringing-it-home&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Bringing it home&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we’ve toured a good bit of technology which might be feeling a bit abstract at this point. Bringing this home, our front end experience with these technologies can feel no different than any of the “drives” and “boxes” we use to store our files in the cloud. In fact, ThreeFold has already developed a prototype file browser based on QSFS which has many cool features like editing documents and viewing media directly in the web interface. It’s one piece of a full suite of solutions we’re excited to showcase and invite the community to test soon.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
I hope you found this piece informative and approachable. Thanks for joining me to learn and explore the wonderful world of ThreeFold technology.

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-intro-to-the-threefold-grid&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An Intro to the ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a farmer or member of the ThreeFold community, you may be wondering about the capacity provided by the ThreeFold Grid and how it’s relevant to individuals and businesses who currently rely on centralized corporate clouds. This can be hard to imagine, because the back end infrastructure that makes all of our apps and services tick is generally invisible to us. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece will be the first in a series where I’ll be working to understand what the technical components are and how ThreeFold provides an alternative with distinct benefits for individuals, businesses, and for the planet as a whole. But don’t worry, we’ll start from the ground level and build up understanding in a way that’s accessible to everyone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;infrastructure-for-a-new-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#infrastructure-for-a-new-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: infrastructure-for-a-new-internet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Infrastructure for a New Internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is the internet? In short, it is a network of interconnected devices that facilitates communication and commerce. These devices include our mobile phones and personal computers, but also the servers that store and process data to provide the end experiences we enjoy. Currently the vast majority of these servers live in massive data centers controlled by a handful of corporations. ThreeFold is changing this, by allowing anyone to connect computational and storage capacity to an open network that is available for all to use, known as the ThreeFold Grid. Our farmers do include some data centers operating on a smaller scale than major cloud providers, and also many individuals connecting nodes at their home or office all over the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the ThreeFold Grid, servers are known as 3Nodes. A 3Node can be pretty much any modern computer system, offering capacity by running the Zero OS operating system. This is a major distinguishing factor, both from the traditional cloud computing world and also from other projects working to create decentralized networks in this space. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-os-for-a-next-generation-cloud&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-os-for-a-next-generation-cloud&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-os-for-a-next-generation-cloud&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The OS for a Next Generation Cloud&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By starting from the operating system level, ThreeFold is able to provide a network with much stronger security and greater efficiency than anything that came before. Zero OS includes a collection of components, known as “primitives”, which provide developers with everything they need. These primitives can be used to migrate existing applications from the legacy cloud and also to create new solutions that leverage the Grid’s capacity in unique ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with operating systems like Windows and MacOS that provide an interface to applications on our personal computers. The OS interacts with the underlying hardware to expose its capabilities in a way that’s useful for both the software it hosts and also the humans who utilize it. For example, when you launch an app on your phone, it is the OS that’s responsible for connecting it to data networks and providing access to peripherals like cameras or microphones. Things are a little different in the world of servers, where rather than through direct interactions, users benefit through the services provided to the applications we use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To extend the example, when you open a messaging app it will connect to a server somewhere to check for new messages and relay any messages you are sending to the recipient. Here we can see a central issue that has inspired the design of ThreeFold’s technology: when our messages pass through servers controlled by others, it creates an open door for surveillance of all kinds.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold farmers, on the other hand, have no administrative access to their nodes. Furthermore, each component offered by the ThreeFold Grid is built with the intention of allowing for secure and private storage, processing, and transmission of information. Of course, sharing is absolutely possible, but only when the creator of data or content chooses for it to happen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-essential-resources&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#three-essential-resources&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: three-essential-resources&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Three Essential Resources&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of cloud computing, we speak of three basic resources provided by servers: compute, storage, and network. The ThreeFold Grid provides various primitives in each of these     categories, to fulfill all the same needs served by centralized cloud providers. While our offerings have the special properties discussed above, they are also highly compatible with the most popular tools and protocols currently used in the industry. This makes it relatively simple to migrate the back end applications, also known as “workloads”, that provide a kind of connective tissue for all of the digital experiences we enjoy on a daily basis.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workloads are pieces of software that provide services. If you upload a file to some cloud storage service, there could be a number of individual workloads orchestrated together in order to ensure the data you want to save is successfully transmitted to and stored in the back end system. We can understand the need for each kind of capacity by looking at the journey that your file might take in such a scenario. Starting on your device, a network connection, some processing, and finally storage capacity are all involved in providing the conditions that allow you to retrieve that file later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;network&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#network&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: network&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Network&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Networking takes place over cellular connections, wifi, and wired internet lines to move data from one place to another. For our purposes here, those details aren’t so important—we’ll focus on what happens once communication is completed by whatever means. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you connect to the cloud storage service, there are network workloads that transmit your data to the appropriate services that process and store it. This might consist of some routing and also authentication that ensures that you and only you access the files that are associated with your account. On the Grid, we provide primitives for secure peer to peer communication and also for allowing public access to back end services.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;compute&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#compute&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: compute&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Compute&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute is what happens with data once it reaches its destination. Computers are mostly just fancy adding machines that take numbers and turn them into other numbers according to a set of specifications, which we call software. In our example, the compute step might involve compressing the information so it takes up less space and also deriving some useful statistics like the file’s original size. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many details we’re glossing over here, and the compute resources are ultimately responsible for providing much of our end user experience and the interactivity of the apps we utilize. 3Nodes offer a compute environment that natively runs the vast majority of workloads in use today. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;storage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#storage&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: storage&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Storage&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage, of course, is the disk space where data resides. It can be a little strange to think about, actually, that all of the information you’ve stored online actually has at least one physical location where it exists as many small electrical charges. On the Grid, application developers can access the disks of nodes directly, in a way that’s optimized for energy efficiency. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have more advanced storage solutions that offer unparalleled security and low overhead redundancy, giving users the best possible guarantee that only they have access to their data and that it will actually be there when they go to retrieve it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#looking-forward&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: looking-forward&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Looking Forward&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, network, storage, and compute are the raw elements that give life to the internet we know and love. On the ThreeFold Grid, these elements are expressed in a way that’s both familiar for developers but also pushes the limits of what is possible in terms of technical evolution. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much for joining me on this introductory overview of what the Grid provides. Please join me next time for a deeper dive on some of what we’ve covered and more specifics about how ThreeFold technology represents a quantum leap for cloud computing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>The ThreeFold Grid is by the People, For the People</title>
		<published>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/tf-grid-peoples-internet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when you hear the word Internet? For many, it’s the websites and applications we consume online as end users. But the Internet is much more than this. And ultimately, every action we take online goes through a complex set of automated processes and protocols to store, run, and transmit data (e.g. photos, videos, messages, other files) across the global Internet infrastructure.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, this infrastructure consists of massive, power-hungry data centers, and is largely privatized and owned by tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon – who also happen to own the biggest online “free” platforms. But there’s a catch. By owning both the infrastructure and the digital experiences we consume for free, we were actually turned into products of their business models. Our data is being collected and isn’t owned by us anymore. While data has become the most valuable commodity on earth, don’t you think it’s wrong that we don’t own the value of our data today? 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Today, every individual is worth between US $1,000 and $20,000 online, per year. The Internet and Cloud Industry is worth trillions, yet all this value is centralized to a handful of companies. This has to change.”&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold’s open source technology powers the peer-to-peer Internet revolution that holds the premise to disrupt the global Internet in many ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-internet-by-the-people&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-internet-by-the-people&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-internet-by-the-people&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An Internet By the People&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold Grid is formed by people from all around the world that connect Internet capacity to a peer-to-peer Infrastructure owned by humanity. Together, we expand a data-sovereign and planet-positive Internet infrastructure that puts people back in control of their data, and their digital lives. ThreeFold’s infrastructure can store all of humanity’s data – from personal data to public datasets and security archives – and can run all emerging technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and Big Data – with more efficiency and security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold flips the current data center model upside-down, and allows people around the globe to connect Internet capacity in the form of hardware, and earn income for it. This decentralized approach means that anyone can take part in the world’s largest and fastest growing economy – the Internet and Cloud. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
You can see now how this new Internet is by the people, but how about the latter? What does the ThreeFold Grid enable?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-internet-for-the-people&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-internet-for-the-people&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: an-internet-for-the-people&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;An Internet For the People&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now anyone, anywhere can connect to the ThreeFold Grid and use capacity with some key advantages:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-world-where-we-own-the-value-of-our-data&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-world-where-we-own-the-value-of-our-data&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-world-where-we-own-the-value-of-our-data&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A World Where we Own the Value of Our Data&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, all of the data we create online sits inside of centralized data centers and we do not own it. ThreeFold turns terms &amp;amp; conditions on their head and gives us, the people, full control of our data rather than third parties. We can keep our data private, decide with whom to share it, and even decide on where it’s stored and located. And considering that our personal data is worth between US $1,000 and $20,000 per year, ThreeFold offers a direct way for us to own our digital life and the value attached to it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;we-exchange-value-without-intermediaries&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#we-exchange-value-without-intermediaries&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: we-exchange-value-without-intermediaries&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;We Exchange Value Without Intermediaries&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “People’s Internet” is peer-to-peer. This means connections between senders and recipients are completely end-to-end, eliminating the need for any form of intermediaries from the model. Can you imagine what the world would look like without intermediaries? Let’s take an example like Airbnb.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, if you are looking for a place to stay on vacation, you will probably end up using the services of Airbnb. But did you know that Airbnb charges both consumers and property owners for using their service? In a peer-to-peer world, this wouldn’t be necessary. You’d simply access a database of property owners (possibly through a peer-to-peer marketplace) and be able to complete the transaction yourselves. No hidden fees, just a direct exchange of value!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;applications-run-on-the-edge&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#applications-run-on-the-edge&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: applications-run-on-the-edge&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Applications Run on the Edge&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its essence, edge computing brings compute and storage closer to people (and the devices where it’s being gathered) rather than relying on a centralized data centers located on the other side of the planet. This is the essence of the ThreeFold Grid. So, data doesn’t suffer any latency issues (performance) and it’s far more efficient &#x2F; money-saving. Further, the distributed nature of the Grid allows for true privacy and security. Edge computing is not just a growing trend but, because of the growing number of connected devices and global Internet usage, it’s becoming a real necessity.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;but-what-about-the-planet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#but-what-about-the-planet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: but-what-about-the-planet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;But what about the planet?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been following us, you must already know that the Internet is responsible for 10% or more of the world’s energy consumption. And with decades of experience in the Internet and Cloud industry, ThreeFold co-founders knew how to turn this around. We developed a lightweight operating system and infrastructure, removing unnecessary layers of complexity from the traditional and Web3 models (actually, blockchains are making it even more complex). The ThreeFold technology is always geared towards maximum efficiency while maintaing performance. And with these advancements, we can already save up-to 90% energy on storage workloads.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Additionally, the distributed nature of the Grid uses less bandwidth (see above re: edge computing). It’s been reported that Netflix alone takes up 15% of the Internet’s bandwidth. What if Netflix were to leverage the ThreeFold Grid? If stored closer to watchers, we could reduce network usage considerably.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our commitment to the planet goes beyond the technology. Through a partnership with Take Action Global (TAG), we aim to take three times more CO2 out of the air compared to what we put in. Imagine regenerating the earth while using the Internet?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
At ThreeFold, we believe that it’s time for us to take back control. As the world turns more and more digital due to the pandemic and even just the natural progression of technology, it’s time that we not just realize the problems of today’s Internet, but that we do something about it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This will happen! So join in, and spread the word! &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Introducing Certified Farming for a More Secure ThreeFold Grid</title>
		<published>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/introducing-certified-capacity/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month, we went live with Titan V2.1, and we’re thrilled to count +1,000 orders already from all over the world.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While orders keep on coming in, we are happy to launch the Certified Farming Program. Certification brings more security to 3Nodes and hence to the ThreeFold Grid, while also providing more rewards to Farmers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-security-for-everyone&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#more-security-for-everyone&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: more-security-for-everyone&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;More Security For Everyone&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While anyone can connect hardware to the ThreeFold Grid, some workloads require the highest level of security standards. Certified hardware can only be booted by Zero-OS and allows for 100% tamper-proof capacity. With certification, ThreeFold is pushing the limits further and creating a new global standard for hardware security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
There are key benefits for Farmers to certify their capacity: 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a certified capacity label: Some developers and enterprises will seek for the highest levels of security. With the certified label, you will be able to provide capacity for their workloads at a higher price.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved hardware security: While DIY farming already provides incredible security, certified farming is 100% tamper-proof. Now you can bring more security to the ThreeFold Grid and to the people using it. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re building a more secure future for our digital lives. This will happen! 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.s. If you’re already a farmer and would like to be featured on our websites please &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forms.gle&#x2F;cW6uFUhkohSw81KT6&quot;&gt;fill out this form.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; Let’s introduce the world to the farming community behind this awesome project!&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Farming Rewards logic can be found &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
You will see that the farming rewards were simplified, and are now calculated according to the compute and storage units (CU &amp;amp; SU) provided to the ThreeFold Grid. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Also, as of this summer, Farmers will be able to earn more TFT for the Network traffic happening on their 3Nodes. The amount of data coming in and out of their CU and SU will determine extra rewards in the form of Network Units (NU).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certified NU: 0.3 TFT per GB per month&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DIY NU: 0.2 TFT per GB per month&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 3Nodes bought from ThreeFold after June 5 2021 are eligible for certified farming. We will send instructions to everyone that purchased a Titan v2.1 on how to upgrade to a certified 3Node next week. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
For people that already bought an earlier batch of nodes, we are thinking of a solution for becoming certified, as our hardware partners need the physical 3Node to certify the hardware.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All certified hardware is 100% dedicated to the ThreeFold Grid. While DIY nodes can be booted with a different Operating System, this is not possible with a Certified 3Node.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All certified hardware is automatically subject to the 3.0 Farming Logic. Read more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__farming_reward&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERE&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The United Nations publicly ruled Internet access to be a human right in 2016. Proper access to the Internet helps to protect people’s freedom of speech and thought, as well as other fundamentals such as access to knowledge and information.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Nonetheless, as of 2019, about 43% of humanity remains unconnected to the Internet, creating huge inequalities in access to information and knowledge. It is essential to take the necessary steps to strengthen the relationship between governments and people while still upholding all human rights.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold created an infrastructure that is easily affordable and jointly operated by network peers to make the modern Internet open and fair to everyone. Anybody with a network connection and electricity can add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. We’re looking for farmers around the globe and we’re also partnering with farming cooperatives to develop localized strategies and meet the specific needs of their region. Plus, the Foundation will incentivize and sponsor the extension and scope to areas that require Internet capacity the most, to ensure a fair and equitable delivery of the Internet to all.

		<title>How You Can Join the People&#x27;s Internet</title>
		<published>2021-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-06-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/join-the-peoples-internet/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/join-the-peoples-internet/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s right. With ThreeFold, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; become the Internet! Let me quickly explain. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today’s Internet is powered by hyper-scale data centers which are owned by large corporations. With +80% of the global infrastructure and +60% of the global Internet networks owned by a bunch of companies, the Internet became a real business with us humans being the products of that business model.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold creates an entirely new Internet economy that is owned by all of us and makes the traditional cloud model of building data centers obsolete. With ThreeFold, independent people called “Farmers” plug in 3Nodes (hardware) from their homes or offices anywhere around the world. And they earn income for it. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Together, they power a new, data-sovereign, and planet-positive Internet owned and powered by the people. This is a game-changer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So, how do I get a 3Node?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy one of the ready-made nodes from cooperatives around the world. This is a good and very easy way to support the ThreeFold project and to “BE THE INTERNET.”
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today you can buy a 3Node via our website. We are also working with our farming cooperatives to decentralize the provisioning and distribution of hardware to a glocal approach (a global network of local networks). 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
But what if 3Nodes are not immediately available? For example, last week we had a huge influx of orders for our Titan V2 3Nodes and sold out the entire batch with 3,000 extra orders. We’re now talking with many hardware distributors to make sure we can satsify all these orders, but this could take a while.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So if you are a little bit more adventurous, and want to build your 3Node from the ground up, yourself, here’s how to do it:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To “become the Internet” is fairly simple (but does take some technical knowledge and effort). Here’s what you’ll need:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A computer with an INTEL or AMD brain, some memory, and some storage cabilities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A smartphone on which you can download and run the “ThreeFold Connect” app. This will provide you with a wallet (to receive your farmed TFT and to pay a very small amount of TFT to get started).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A laptop &#x2F; desktop (and USB stick) to launch your online 3Bot, configure your farm, download your bootloader and burn the bootloader to a USB stick.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some technical knowledge, interest and 45 minutes of time.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still here and reading, we’re good to go! I go through the whole process in a 3-minute video which will give you a quick overview of how to set up your farm. (Click through to the video on YouTube and find helpful links in the description.)

		<title>A Smart Contract for all IT workloads</title>
		<published>2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/smart-contract-blog/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/smart-contract-blog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold was inspired by the blockchain burst when it was created in 2016. After doing a comprehensive scan of the technological space we realized that Blockchain holds the best technology to store (1) Smart Contracts and (2) Transactions in an immutable way. We created our own blockchain database: Rivine to host the Smart Contract layer before switching to the Parity Substrate of Polkadot and our Transactional blockchain to the Stellar Network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While we use blockchain technology, ThreeFold is much more than just “a blockchain project” as we apply many more revolutionary technologies. We decided to use Parity Substrate as we don’t see the need to create something if there’s already great technologies out there that we can already use. Today we’re proud of our Smart Contract for IT layer and approach the ThreeFold Grid v3.0 release this year which will expose its full potential to interact with the primitives of the grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-this-smart-contract-for-it-about&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is this Smart Contract for IT about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smart Contract for IT allows you, your company or your community to execute the storage and running of your files and applications securely with consensus and automatic billing. You could compare it as a fingerprint check and your data would be accessible only if presenting your private key (fingerprint). Let’s maybe go through the process for a better idea of how this works.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The smart contracts are like recipes for chefs to cook exactly what you want. In that sense they need to be very accurate and as descriptive as possible to deliver what you need. In the case of ThreeFold, the smart contracts would define different sets of Internet resources you would need to store files, run applications, or communicate across the network.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Whenever you want to reserve more resources to store your latest album or run your applications, you will define the resources you need to your 3Bot or Digital Twin (your personal virtual system administrators) which will then look at different smart contracts that are available and choose the most appropriate package. For e.g. Reserve 3 PB of Storage in Switzerland across 7 nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Following that, your 3Bot or Digital Twin will create and register the smart contract in the blockchain database in a few seconds, providing you with all your specific needs. It will also store and secure some instructions to the BCDB for the nodes to meet smart contract completion. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold had to make sure that user data would remain ultra-secure. Inspired by storage and communication algorithms used in space, we integrated it between the Smart Contract layer and Zero OS. The algorithm splits data into unrecognizable ‘slices’ that are distributed via network connections to different nodes locally or across the world, and that can be reconstructed only with your fingerprint. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: more-than-the-average-smart-contract&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;More than the average Smart Contract&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Via your Smart Contract for IT, you can also define a consensus mechanism and create multi-signatures for smart contract execution or completion to deliver appropriate digital services in for example work related activities. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The beauty of the Smart Contract for IT is that it can work with thousands of connected nodes for the proper execution of any digital requirements on the infrastructure, verify if consensus was reached or not, download the right files to execute the smart contract and verify them, make sure that no hacker or outsider can ever gain access or influence its execution and more.

		<title>How ThreeFold offers Data Sovereignty</title>
		<published>2021-05-23T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-data-sovereignty/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=uaaC57tcci0&quot;&gt;The Social Dilemma&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, you know all too well that today, people are being turned into products. Everything we do online – all of the data we upload and all of our digital activities – is tracked and oftentimes used against us. Targeted advertising is just the beginning.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Personal data is used by algorithms to make incredible important decisions, like whether someone should receive financial or health support or benefits. In China, people are now even receiving “scores” for their behaviors. It sounds like Black Mirror, but it’s real life.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That’s the scary part. The good news is that things don’t have to be this way. ThreeFold is building the engine for an Internet where people can finally be data sovereign.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__why_intro?id=everyone-should-be-autonomous&quot;&gt;today’s Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, infrastructure is centralized. Companies provide services in exchange for your personal data, which is stored on servers in hyper-scale data centers owned by private companies.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In ThreeFold’s model, those servers are called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__3node&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and rather than sitting inside centralized data centers, they sit inside the homes or offices (or small data centers) owned by independent people and organizations called &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;threefold__farming_intro?id=what-is-3node&quot;&gt;Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. But the data inside is owned by the person or persons who put it there. They maintain access right as well. From a technical standpoint, data is dispersed across 3Nodes by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__part5_ultra_efficient_storage?id=the-space-algorithm-of-storage&quot;&gt;an algorithm&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that makes it such that nobody can access it. In addition, connections are peer-to-peer, meaning data goes directly between sender and recipient rather than passing through intermediaries as it does today – bringing further levels of security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Thus, people can finally be data sovereign, knowing their data is safe, and truly theirs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/zero-os-blog/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just like a brain is an interconnected network of neurons, the Internet (or internet) is a global interconnected network of computers and devices that communicate with each other via the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Internet_protocol_suite&quot;&gt;Internet protocol suite&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; (TCP&#x2F;IP). The communications infrastructure of the Internet consists of hardware components and a system of software layers that control various aspects of the architecture.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To create a new Internet from scratch, ThreeFold had to start at the operating system (OS) level. An operating system is a software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. And this is how Zero OS was born &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-makes-zero-os-special&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-makes-zero-os-special&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-makes-zero-os-special&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What makes Zero OS special?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero OS is a stateless and lightweight operating system. Given it has no shell, remote or server interface, it is much safer than the big majority of the OSs on the market. When storing your data on Zero OS, it is fingerprinted and made available only when requested by you or those you provide access to.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The state of an application represents its state of being in a given moment in time. Think of a stateless transaction as vending machines, a single request and a response. In ThreeFold’s Internet infrastructure, this can be represented as data being accessible only when requested. 
The only way to access data on Zero OS is via the private key (or fingerprint) of a user. In that sense, the data is not accessible unless the data owner requests access to it. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-zero-os-apply-to-developers&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does Zero OS apply to developers?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its lightweight architecture, Zero OS is a perfect fit to run microservice architectures and emerging IT workloads such as IoT, Blockchains, Big Data, and more. A key benefit of microservice architecture is the freedom it offers you to choose the best runtime for the task at hand. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Let’s take the example of decentralizing service-oriented developing teams. A common challenge there is that most of the time they don’t really understand the applications they are exposing. But no one knows the data infrastructure of the applications better than those who craft them. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold permits decentralized developer teams with the ability to share keys (access) to the developing environment on Zero OS and the gateways to the world wide web within the secure peer-to-peer overlay network. This is game changing. Also with all the automation frameworks provided, it creates the perfect environment to develop current and emerging technologies. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Put shortly, decentralized development and integration is now officially an organizational or cultural change, not a technical one anymore.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: zero-os-allows-anyone-to-provide-sovereign-capacity&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Zero OS allows anyone to provide sovereign capacity&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given stateless systems separate the OS configuration and user data, Zero OS simplifies the  maintenance and the deployment of digital workloads, while making it impossible to hack into user data on a hardware level. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
3Nodes provide all the storage, compute and network primitives for a new internet infrastructure. Given they are booted with Zero OS, anyone can now participate in the Internet economy without jeopardizing user data sovereignty and security.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Conclusively, Zero OS is ultra secure, perfect to develop current and future technologies, and enables anyone to take part in the planet positive and data sovereign Internet brought by ThreeFold.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>ThreeFold’s Planet Positive Plan</title>
		<published>2021-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-05-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-regenerates/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-regenerates/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There’s no question that climate change is one of the biggest, if not the biggest threats facing humanity today. If we care at all about future generations and the health of our planet, we have no choice but to address these threats, and fast. That’s why one of our biggest aims is to lower the energy usage of our digital lives. But ThreeFold is taking not just a sustainable approach, we’re setting the plan for a planet positive Internet.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Recently, we released information on how our infrastructure saves up-to-90% on energy consumption compared to existing models. We achieve this mainly thanks to an extremely efficient storage system and the concept of a Digital Twin.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
From &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_storage&quot;&gt;a storage standpoint&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we reduce energy by avoiding copies, implementing a multi-layer system, not using fast disks, through read&#x2F;write caching, and more. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_digital_twin&quot;&gt;Digital Twin&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we have taken a very different approach to how we exist in today’s digital world. Rather than existing 100 times in a huge system of client-server architecture, now we exist only once. We believe that we can run 25 Digital Twins with &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__bulb_comparison_twin&quot;&gt;the same energy&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; as used by one light bulb.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Saving energy is one thing, but there will still be remaining energy. This needs to be offset by carbon credits. Now, in order to regenerate our planet, we &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;threefold__carbon_negative&quot;&gt;work together with Take Action Global&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to let students farm carbon credits. This has the potential to offset energy usage 100% by the end of 2021, and we have, as an aim to take 2x more carbon out of the air than we put in.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our planet needs better solutions across industries. No more talking. Now is the time to act.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today’s Internet consumes approximately 10% of the world’s energy. This is not acceptable.

&lt;br&gt;
So, how to fix this? Start from scratch. Attack the root problems. Build a new infrastructure. Go peer-to-peer. Reduce complexity. Improve efficiency. Work with like-minded partners. &lt;em&gt;No one is taking this approach, apart from ThreeFold.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In most distributed systems, data is stored multiple times to guarantee redundancy. This leads to a lot of unnecessary overhead and is also not the most secure mechanism.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Meet &lt;strong&gt;the dispersed storage algorithm&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; – a crucial part of our storage system – which breaks data down into equations that are spread across nodes, leading to increased security, reliability, and efficiency, with much lower overhead.

		<title>What Is Peer-to-Peer and Why Is It so Important?</title>
		<published>2020-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-12-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/what-is-peer-to-peer/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is Peer-to-Peer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer-to-peer (P2P) is a term that originated from the distributed computer application architecture where tasks and workloads are shared between peers, popularized by &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Napster&quot;&gt;Napster&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a revolutionary file storing system from the late 1990s.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The concept inspired new structures and philosophies in many areas of human interaction. P2P systems and groups are typically critical of authoritarian and centralized social structures and believe in equality, meritocracy, flat systems, participatory &amp;amp; circular economies, as the concept represents a concrete pathway to these outcomes or visions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
P2P systems are network, not linear or ‘pyramidal’ hierarchies (though they may share some elements). They are ‘distributed’, though they may have elements of ‘centralization’ and ‘decentralization.’ And intelligence is not located at any center, but everywhere within the system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-threefold-relate-to-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does ThreeFold relate to peer-to-peer?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing network is a distributed architecture that splits tasks and workloads between its peers, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;#&#x2F;what_is_farming&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Farmers are equal participants in the network and together they form a peer-to-peer network of nodes, the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Farmers make their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Farmers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Client-server&quot;&gt;client-server&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the near future, ThreeFold will create Digital Twin, which will go beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources. It will actually enable much more than that. Digital Twin will create a complete new digital world with diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Virtual_community&quot;&gt;virtual community&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the ThreeFold Grid. This will empower the network of peers to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, and are beneficial to all the peers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-did-threefold-choose-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why did ThreeFold choose peer-to-peer? &lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything starts (or should start) from the why, and the ThreeFold story started a long time ago. Before the inception of ThreeFold, many of the co-founders of the project used to work with the largest IT &amp;amp; Cloud actors. Throughout their experience working in the Industry, they realized that the complexity of the technology and the centralization of knowledge &amp;amp; power led to an inefficient, unsustainable, not scalable and unequally distributed infrastructure. So they decided to redesign the whole Internet and cloud infrastructure bottom-up with the vision of shaping a global internet economy that can scale anywhere efficiently, cost efficiently and sustainably. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-does-the-world-needs-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why does the world needs peer-to-peer? &lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By developing the technology, the conviction that peer-to-peer was the best solution for humanity and the planet strengthened itself. Why? Well, put simply, a peer-to-peer system removes all forms of intermediaries, unnecessary steps and complexity from the picture. Therefore, it simplifies the architecture in an incredible way. The benefits are many but here are the most popular benefits:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Privacy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Our peer-to-peer environment means no middlemen or intermediaries, meaning data travels directly between peers and stored on the nodes of their choice rather than being sent through and stored by a third party.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: Data stored in data centers is susceptible to security breaches. In bypassing data centers and exchanging data directly between peers, we can achieve much greater security as it reduces code and back doors significantly. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: In a many-to-many system, scale is essentially unlimited. There is simply no bottleneck. And hardware (nodes) can be added at ease compared to current data center model.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cost-efficiency &amp;amp; Sustainability&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;: End-to-end (direct) connection between peers means a more efficient path for data and less energy is needed. Less energy means less cost, and less harm to our planet.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: in-2021-the-world-is-going-peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;In 2021 the world is going peer-to-peer! &lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re now in 4 years into the project, and it is clear that ThreeFold holds the most advanced technology and is probably the only tech company in the world that can achieve a peer-to-peer network &amp;amp; digital world as envisioned by the concept authors. The ThreeFold Grid is running and already at it’s 2.4 version and 2021 will bring various commercial opportunities for the public to partake in the peer-to-peer network, from hosting IT workloads to experiencing P2P end-user solutions. In other words, in 2021, the world will be able to go peer-to-peer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Why Anyone Should Consider Becoming A (ThreeFold) Farmer</title>
		<published>2020-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2020-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold Foundation is changing the way how &quot;we&quot; as a whole approach the internet and its underlying technology. We believe building the internet back from the ground up is the only way to dismantle the monster it has grown into – a polluting greed-machine that allows people’s data to be abused for money all while just being accessible to just half of the earth’s inhabitants.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And the best part is, you can have a part in the global shift towards a more sustainable, inclusive, and respectful internet by becoming a ThreeFold Farmer.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-are-farmers&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-are-farmers&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-are-farmers&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what are farmers?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put: Farmers are people that add capacity to the ThreeFold Grid for anyone to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-this-capacity&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-this-capacity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-this-capacity&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is this “capacity”?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity is the raw building blocks needed for any internet grid: CPU (processors), Hard Drives, Solid-state drives, memory, etc. Capacity can then be rented by developers and engineers that would like to run their applications on the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-in-it-for-me&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-in-it-for-me&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-in-it-for-me&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is in it for me?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the previous paragraph, capacity is rented. This means people that put capacity on the ThreeFold Grid are getting paid by anybody that uses their capacity. But there is more, ThreeFold also incentivizes farmers to add capacity by giving them tokens simply for adding the capacity to the ThreeFold Grid. The amount they receive depends on the specifications of the capacity they put online (how much, how powerful, etc). These tokens are then gradually released over the course of 60 months. So in short, you get paid to do this.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-else&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-else&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-else&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What else?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacity for the ThreeFold Grid can be added in all shapes and sizes. It could be a small box no larger than a modem that you put in your office or home, or could be a fully-fledged data center node. The idea is that the grid becomes spread out as much as it can be, as this has some huge benefits for all users and the environment.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less power waste: Less energy is needed to cool all these smaller nodes that are far away from each other, than putting the same resources in a giant room together and having them sit on top off, and beside each other (this is what happens now in large scale data centers).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less bandwidth waste: The closer the capacity is to the end-user, the less unnecessary miles it has to travel. (e.g. a text message in a messaging app might travel from the Netherlands to a data center in America to then forward it to the person living down the street). When concentrating on decentralization and having nodes everywhere in the world this problem resolves itself. And data will take the shortest route possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Privacy: This decentralized approach makes it so that there is no “all-seeing eye” within the network – unlike the current setup where tech giants basically own all their users’ data by putting it in their own data centers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Accessibility: Due to the fact that these resources can be added in small form-factors, it makes it possible to now put internet resources anywhere in the world where there’s a network to plug into (cables in the ground). And this makes it that now people that have limited-to-no funds have access to what the UN declared a human right: the internet. ut more than that, education, connection, entertainment, all the internet brought the western world over the past decade.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The current growth of internet needs 4000+ new large scale data centers of computer systems. The global data growth will reach more than 40 Zetabytes by 2020 which represents an average yearly growth of 42% starting at 4.5 Zetabytes in 2013. To host all this data, over 4000 new big data centers have to to be built. And to achieve this goal, $ 1 trillion USD investment capital is needed and land totalling the size of the UK would be needed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The Internet is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. In this article we&#x27;ll explain why that&#x27;s not always such a good thing and where we see opportunities.
&lt;h2 id=&quot;internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: internet-capacity-needs-to-become-localized&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Internet capacity needs to become localized&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big majority of users in the world connect to servers that are not present in their region and as such experience higher costs and low performance. According to a study by datacentermap.com, 80% of the data centers of the current Internet’s service providers are based in the U.S. and Europe. The rest of the world has scarce Internet resources dotted around territories.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As a consequence most Internet users use Internet-based services running on infrastructure which is located far away from their physical location and most likely outside their country’s borders. This decreases the general end-user experience (latency) but also adds unnecessary costs to transporting the information back and forth. Also, it adds legislation and compliance headaches to enterprises.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Our mission is to empower and inspire people to recognize abundance by living new experiences one hour at a time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-perform-better&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-perform-better&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-perform-better&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to perform better&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compute and Storage vendors create poor-performing solutions. There have been yearly improvements in hardware following Moore’s law. While this has allowed ThreeFold to progress and innovate, it has also led to software developers taking these advances for granted; cutting corners where they can, creating sub-optimal code and allowing software components to be layered on top of each other to achieve certain behavioral functionalities.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The inefficiencies have now led to a situation where organically-grown IT architectures are immensely complex. They use a variety of components from different software and hardware vendors integrated by so called ‘integrators’. The overall effort and cost involved to create, operate and maintain such architectures is growing continuously and requiring an ever-increasing budget and resourcing to continue.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
If we could go down to the core algorithms and take another look at these, and innovate at the heart of technology instead of applying patches and pain killers, we would be able to create much more end-user capacity than what systems provide today. Systems will last longer and will not have to be replaced by faster ones. Also, fewer engineers will be needed to create, operate and maintain these systems. Combined, these elements would present a more stable and reliable platform that can achieve higher levels of uptime.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Only upsides, right? Well a huge downside of such an approach is that vendors will make less revenue and more importantly less margin as systems will run for longer, be more stable and require less updates. So why would vendors innovate at the core of their solution?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-become-more-sustainable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-become-more-sustainable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-become-more-sustainable&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to become more sustainable&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the current Internet is responsible for between 5 and 10% of global energy consumptions? Making it more harmful to our planet than the airline Industry. The good news is that we can achieve 10x more power efficiency by addressing certain areas such as storage.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold believes IT can do a much better job at being more sustainable - in fact ThreeFold believes it can reduce the Internet’s carbon footprint by 10 times compared to other industry standards in IT capacity producing solutions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance that in theory would require more racks and cooling. ThreeFold’s architectural approach brought solutions that enables it’s Farmers to achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses fewer racks) and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-become-more-affordable&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to become more affordable&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest cost in running IT architectures is the human cost. Today’s complex systems, built out of ‘band aid and patches’ point solutions, organically-grown and badly documented IT infrastructures, need an armada of people to keep them ticking. Even though this is an example, one can learn a lot from the trends that are presented:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of Full-time equivalent in the company, of which 85% are insourced and 15% on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn’t retain internal know-how to operate their IT.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About 50% of IT budgets are spent on Infrastructure ane operations. Similarly, a big part goes to applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the IT department.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Around 65% of the IT budget is spent on resources and services, around 35% is spent on hardware and software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
These figures present industry average numbers and paint a troubling picture that IT is a sizeable part of an overall budget, and that most spending is going to have the right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture it relies on. For any other discipline in any organisation this would present an unacceptable risk to the business and its continuity - strangely not for IT.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-needs-to-become-self-healing&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet needs to become self-healing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest source of downtime in computer systems is people. Getting people involved in fixing infrastructure problems creates the risk of accidentally causing more system downtime. A very recent example on this hit a large organisation cloud service provider.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
20+ years ago when Internet data centers came into existence next to telecom points of presence (POP), the level of complication in architecting, and building and maintaining these infrastructures exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of data around the globe, these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to, processed, and the obtained results sent back to end users on the other side of the globe.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Managing a data center that contains solutions for information transportation, storage and processing is not an easy task and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented in regards to the processing and storing of information has also exploded. This resulted in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build, operate and maintain these IT systems.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The time has come that we no longer rely on people to do the right thing in case of emergency - the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on the availability of that information is huge. Having people to do manual deployments and operational responsibilities does not provide the agility and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to take the human element out of IT and let smart and autonomous systems to take over. This will also let people focus on more creative activities.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-world-needs-a-responsible-internet&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The world needs a responsible internet&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a humanitarian level the opportunities for creativity, learning and development are currently negatively influenced by a lack of access to performant and affordable Internet services. Since &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7#:%7E:text=Due%20to%20the%20lack%20of,20.&quot;&gt;Internet access is a human right&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, it should protect the status quo between the developed and less-developed regions of our world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-internet-is-growing-fast-with-the-wrong-solutions&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Internet is growing fast, with the wrong solutions&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is evident that the current solutions are super unsustainable and make no sense. Luckily, ThreeFold and many other start-ups are deploying new solutions.

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1989, the Internet changed the world as we know it with the introduction of the World Wide Web. With time the Internet empowered people to share information in a decentralized way. Shortly after, big companies like Facebook, Google, and Apple emerged, providing many solutions that revolutionized the way we live. The “sharing economy” has grown exponentially over the last 5-10 years. This is thanks to a more simplified information flow and well-developed technology, which:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables a much easier integration of independent players into the sharing economy.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminates the need for extensive management and structure of marketplace operators.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We are entering a flat-structure economy. An economy where fewer managerial levels are needed for the system to function. New technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things facilitate this ongoing trend. Participants can now interact on a peer-to-peer basis, forming marketplaces and organizations according to pre-agreed, programmed contracts.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-current-internet-is-centralized&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-current-internet-is-centralized&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-current-internet-is-centralized&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The current Internet is centralized&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the growth in popularity for decentralized systems, organizations, and currencies, the Internet remains centralized. The centralization within the Internet industry brought many barriers to entry. Indeed, to compete in the highly competitive market of Internet capacity dominated by big IT companies, massive investment, and IT development are needed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
But what is really scary is that the current industry exploits the market tremendously. Data is officially the most valuable asset on earth for a few years, and about 20 companies rule over more than 80% of the cloud industry. In other words - these companies together have more than 80% of the world’s information. In recent years, we noticed the dangers that can arise with the wrong intentions within the data industry with the ‘Cambridge Analytica Scandal’, also highlighted in the movie &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=iX8GxLP1FHo&quot;&gt;‘The Great Hack’.&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold has been developing technology that allows the decentralization of the Internet infrastructure - removing the need for data centers, and allowing anyone to take part in the Internet capacity market. Adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid (TF Grid) makes you a ThreeFold Farmer (TF Farmer). The more decentralized the Internet gets, the more secure and effective it will become. The already is the largest grid of compute and storage in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-participate&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-to-participate&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-to-participate&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How To Participate&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of becoming a ThreeFold Farmer is very straightforward. Anyone can join the ThreeFold Grid by downloading the ThreeFold Zero-OS onto their nodes and connecting them to the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By doing this you will become an operator of a “micro data center” and with that earn ThreeFold Tokens. With or without experience in the field, anyone can become a ThreeFold Farmer. By becoming a ThreeFold Farmer, you empower a new neutral Internet that belongs to humanity - not corporations.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
You can build your server (3node) and configure it, but also options for people with less technical knowledge are available. Please see &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pre-register.threefold.io&quot;&gt;pre-register.threefold.io&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to see how easy it is for anyone to become a ThreeFold Farmer.

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold’s technology does not follow the traditional IT model&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edge internet needs a different approach. So, we started from scratch and shaped a new approach. ThreeFold’s open-source technology addresses the scalability, security, storage, energy, and operating issues by simplifying architectures and not relying on third-party software. This drives down costs and improves efficiencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is ThreeFold’s Technology Toolbox?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s technology is based on three primary building blocks:  Stateless Computing, Self-Healing Technology, and Blockchain technology - this is the core of our “Technology Toolbox“.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stateless Computing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Edge Internet grid generating IT storage and compute capacity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Healing Technology&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: controls and operates a distributed cloud and reserves, procures, and executes workloads on the grid using our Jumpscale platform. It delivers autoscaling and automation frameworks that enable self-healing and can be adapted for any kind of IT workload.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain Technology&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Via Rivine - our secure, scalable “proof of stake” blockchain, along with our identity management platform, ItsYou.online. Our blockchain technology enables user authentication, access controls, secure workloads, and heightened security.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabling-stateless-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#enabling-stateless-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: enabling-stateless-computing&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Enabling Stateless Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global decentralized internet will be composed of thousands (millions?) of nodes distributed geographically.  This means the decentralized internet must be powered by a stateless operating system that can be booted via the Internet (as opposed to living on the node locally). This removes the complexity of upgrades, truck rolls, etc. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Open-source components have been developed, Zero-OS, for the deployment of bare metal machines functioning as Internet nodes and application hosts.  Our Zero-OS platform runs containerized applications and software code on secure and distributed IT infrastructure.  Zero-OS can be deployed on off-the-shelf hardware by anyone willing to make server and storage capacity available in their markets and within our network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-benefits-of-stateless-computing-are-substantial-including&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The benefits of Stateless Computing are substantial, including:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: lightweight OS without overhead for running bare-metal machines.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: finds the optimal performance of server &amp;amp; storage nodes at no cost.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: no data footprint remains while workloads move from one node to another.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: capacity is generated without the need for data centers: At The Edge.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-available&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: easy creation of clusters while applications run in fragmented segments.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Portability&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: moving software from one node to another within the grid is instant.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: open-source distributed software with transparent code. No security backdoors&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: energy-efficient OS resulting in very low node power consumption.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: technology-that-is-self-healing-self-driving&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Technology that is self-healing &amp;amp; self-driving&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold’s Jumpscale framework and ZeroBot allow the creation of blueprints to auto-deploy applications within the compute environment. The bots are constantly checking the health and uptime of the infrastructure, and runtime environments, to guarantee the performance and availability of applications at all times.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-benefits-of-our-self-healing-technology-protocols-include-the-following&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The benefits of our self-healing technology protocols include the following:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Healing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the platform regenerates when health issues that cause downtime for infrastructure and applications are detected. &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: agents capture information from the grid and make intelligent decisions to provide an ideal and optimal host environment for software code and containerized applications.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifecycle Management&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the status of the infrastructure and the lifecycle of running applications are constantly checked and recorded.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autoscaling&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: the platform automatically scales to meet application and infrastructure performance.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-technology-to-execute-workloads-and-applications-via-smart-contracts&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain Technology to execute workloads and applications via smart contracts&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineers developed new blockchain algorithms based on proof of stake for validation purposes and turned this into our Rivine open-source blockchain software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Unlike the “proof of work” blockchains that currently dominate the space, our Rivine blockchain is scalable, green, and secure - and does not rely on huge mining resources.  We run our blockchain on approximately 200 dedicated nodes and do not rely on any third-party software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition to our blockchain technology, we have also developed ItsYou.Online, an identity, and access management platform.  Itsyou. online uses three-factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-tf-blockchain-technology-and-identity-management-platform-include&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-benefits-of-tf-blockchain-technology-and-identity-management-platform-include&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-benefits-of-tf-blockchain-technology-and-identity-management-platform-include&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The benefits of TF blockchain technology and identity management platform include:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainable&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: our algorithms to reach consensus use a minimal amount of energy and electricity compared to other blockchain software and networks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lowest possible cost&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: of transactions make it an efficient and fast payment system.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: state of the network and applications are recorded in a transparent and immutable manner.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment fulfillment&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: transactions are automatically paid using ThreeFold Tokens.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart Contracts&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: fully automated execution of contracts from customers buying Internet IT capacity.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All of our technology is open-source and can be accessed in the following Github Repos:

&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has the power to change the world of IT. There are a huge number of new initiatives using blockchain technology around the world, with countless use cases.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In general, there are two types of blockchains: proof of work blockchains and proof of stake blockchains. They are consensus algorithms on how transactions are verified and added to the ledger (forever, as blockchains provide an immutable record of events). More on these two types of blockchains below.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-basics&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-basics&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-basics&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain Basics&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blockchain is, as the word says, a chain of blocks of information. These “blocks” contain information on transactions. For instance transactions like the transfer of value of a digital currency (token) from wallet A to wallet B. The “chain” aspect comes when part of the information is stored in a block as a link to the previous block (a unique number). This is a very simple representation of what a blockchain is.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: private-permissioned-or-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Private, Permissioned or Public Blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complexity around a blockchain comes from how the blockchain software is run. The software can run in two different ways: a small (or large) number of nodes controlled by one single entity (private blockchain) a person or a company, or a large (or small) number of nodes controlled by multiple entities (public) that do not know each other and where anyone interested to run a blockchain node can join.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
By running blockchain software under the supervision of one entity (private, centralized) you can quite easily make sure the information stored in the blockchain (transactions) are not tempered with by only operating a small number of nodes and deploying them in very safe physical locations (private data-centers, vaults, basements of offices, etc). A private blockchain does not allow unknown entities to join and run the blockchain software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A permissioned blockchain is operated by known entities such as stakeholders of a given industry. It is a mix of both private and public blockchains. In this type of blockchain network, a participant may not need permission to join the network but needs permission to transact with another network participant.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A public blockchain allows anyone to join the blockchain operation and create a new blockchain node. The blockchain is run by multiple entities (decentralized, public) that have no relationship nor knowledge about each other 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
For these three types of blockchains, there are different mechanisms to protect and guarantee the validity of transactions and make them tamper-proof.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: private-data-and-anonymous-or-pseudo-anonymous-data&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Private Data and Anonymous or Pseudo-Anonymous Data?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For private blockchains, it is straightforward to see that all data that is stored on private blockchains is private and creates 100% anonymity for its users. The only entity or person that has access to information stored on the blockchain is the blockchain operator. This is comparable to how a bank operates. The bank knows everything about all of its customers and the customers only know about themselves - the non-bank customers do not know a thing.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
On a public blockchain, people can join and operate a blockchain node on which all information of that blockchain is stored. While private blockchains get their security from putting their blockchain nodes in secure buildings operated by trusted people a public blockchain achieves its security from having a large number of nodes that have the same data replicated over and over. A consensus algorithm is required in order to accept new data (new blocks) to the chain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: consensus-protocols-for-public-blockchains&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Consensus Protocols for Public Blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main consensus protocols used today are Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: proof-of-work-high-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Proof of Work (High Cost in Compute and Energy)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proof of work consensus protocol is best explained as a race. The consensus is achieved by having all participating nodes solve a puzzle. The puzzle is a one-way translation of an amount of information consisting of the following items:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the data that present the transactions in the block - all the data is known by all participating nodes&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of the previous block. Remember a blockchain links blocks of information together.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A (variable) number. This number is the part that can be changed.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The “work” is done by changing the variable number and see what the translation of all data brings. The translation of all this data is a new number, and the requirement is that that number needs to be smaller than what is known as the “difficulty level”. The difficulty level number has a fixed amount of numbers but when the first digits of the number are zero the overall number is lower. So a higher difficulty is built by having a number that has more zeros at the start in the difficulty number.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Once the block is completed, all nodes will get the complete block of transactional data, everyone knows the previous block number and will start to change the variable number to get output from the puzzle algorithms comparing it to the required difficulty level.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The node that will find the number first will announce that it has found a solution matching the required difficulty level and the variable number of shared with all nodes in the network to verify that his solution is correct. If a large portion of the nodes has verified the solution to be valid the solution is accepted and the block is added to the chain because consensus is reached.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: proof-of-block-stake-low-cost-in-compute-and-energy&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Proof of (Block) Stake (Low Cost in Compute and Energy)&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With proof of stake consensus algorithms, the consensus algorithm does not solve puzzles in a race to be the first. The first step is to identify and allow a certain number of nodes to be part of the blockchain. This is called a permissioned blockchain because you need to have permission to partake. This permission is given by distributing stakes.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Proof of Stake consensus mechanism is solving a puzzle, but the puzzle contains only static elements - not variables - based on different characteristics:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The block number&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The content (part) of blocks a long time ago (&amp;gt;2000 blocks)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The transaction number (between the first and the last transaction) in the block of the stake transfer transaction all participating nodes needs to&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The current timestamp
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All these numbers are fixed but the time stamp and every node in the block stake blockchain will solve this puzzle every second until the output of this puzzle matches the required difficulty level. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To make sure the one node that has solved the puzzle to match the difficulty level cannot introduce information in the block which allows him to tamper with the next blocks this node cannot use his used stake for a period amount of time for creating new blocks.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The fact that the puzzle-solving includes historic block data and once a node is assigned to create the block and put it on a chain will not be able to use that block state for a period of time makes it very costly to try to tamper with the content of the block (and the next blocks). &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-blockchain-dilemma-problem&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-blockchain-dilemma-problem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-blockchain-dilemma-problem&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The Blockchain Dilemma Problem&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public and private blockchains have their specific advantages and disadvantages and are very good for specific use cases - but not all. If we list the specifics of both we end up with a table like this:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
| * | Public Blockchains | Private Blockchains |
|—|—|—|
| Security | Provided by having a large number of nodes running it | Provided by having them in secure controlled places | 
| People | Build, managed and controlled by unknown people | Build, managed, and controlled by known people |&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
| Speed | Slow by design - all data needs to be copied to all of them | Fast(er) and more efficient by design - a smaller number of copies of the blockchain data |&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So what if we want to have a secure, performant, and easy to manage blockchain solution?  This is not what can be delivered by either type of blockchains.  We have to create a new type of blockchain that combines the best of both worlds and delivers.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The key element in finding a solution for this problem is to take the human element out of it.  The fact that when you deploy blockchains solutions in locations without human intervention means that you need to create a different deployment mechanism that takes out people touching code, compiling code, deploying code, and in the end operating the machine in which the code runs.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A way to get around the trusted people problem is to select a platform on which software can be downloaded, compiled, installed, and operated without human intervention.  Such a platform is a unique platform that has not been developed and launched. Such a platform would have to have the following characteristics. To make this system work and solve the blockchain dilemma we need to have three components working together in an orchestrated way.  The three elements are:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A (simple) operating system that does not allow local and remote logins - a closed operating system that receives instructions to launch or kill applications.  This operating system  needs to be stateless to keep as simple as possible: &lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3Bot&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A virtual system administrator that is able to perform system administration tasks to make the system operate, self-heal and execute instructions from authenticated and authorized sources.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero-Chain&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: A ledger or database to store information with regards to authentication, operational and financial transactions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This system architecture allows for authenticated and trusted virtual system administrators to download, compile and deploy software on a grid of secure Zero-OS nodes with an immutable ledger that records all transactions, operational and financial. This presents a platform on which a public (permissioned) blockchain can be run securely without requiring trusted people to operate the nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In such architecture, we can build and deploy a high-performance secure blockchain which are the combined benefits of a public and private blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-1-bigger-data-centers-are-more-efficient&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 1: Bigger data centers are more efficient&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are advantages in building larger-scale data centers, like economies of scale and sheer bulk buying power, but these are not as significant as what people think. The average cost per rack in a hyper-scale data center is $20-35K USD including all energy requirements and safety systems. The cost of hardware per rack is around the $200-300K USD mark.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
What is often forgotten is that anything that is of enormous scale and highly concentrated comes with complexity and specific problems to deal with. For example. resource requirements such as investment, operational costs, knowledge, and people increase significantly with size.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In reality, keeping things simple, small, and distributed is much more cost-effective than large complex environments.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-2-big-data-centers-can-be-sustainable&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 2: Big data centers can be sustainable&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The carbon footprint of a big data center is enormous. To improve the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of most data center farmers have adopted wind, hydro, and&#x2F;or solar power technologies, which indeed helps drop their PUE by an estimated 20%. But is this leading to more sustainability?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This 20% looks great on paper and in the farmers’ corporate social responsibility reports. However, it just represents an improvement in the cooling technology and sourcing of energy. It doesn’t actually impact the energy consumed by the equipment that runs in their data centers (servers, storage chassis, physical disks, etc.) which is the equipment responsible for the carbon footprint. PUE only refers to overhead power consumption, i.e. cooling the facility, opening, and closing doors, maintaining power security systems, etc.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Real improvement lies in deploying technologies that actually consume less power to deliver the actual Internet capacity to run workloads, real CPU chassis, physical disks, and storage cabinets. Improving on how hardware is being more effectively used can have an impact of up to a thousand percent and lead to ten times more power-efficiency.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-3-redundant-systems-have-better-uptime&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 3: Redundant systems have better uptime&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of us believe that systems need redundancy mechanisms to improve their operational uptime and reliability. While it may make sense to IT experts, let’s translate this for the non-IT world?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To make a car more reliable we add redundancy (as we do in IT). So for the risk of having a puncture, we add one extra tire for all the tires we use continuously. This adds 4 extra tires to the car. Then a decision needs to be made: Do we put those tires in a structure where they are always running along with the primary tires or do we choose not to have them “online” all the time, wearing and tearing in the same way as the primary tires?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Building such a system would take a large number of engineers to come up with a solution, and would change cars as we know them. Wouldn’t it make more sense to think outside the box and solve the root of the problem by making tires un-deflatable?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The IT industry has gone overboard with the concept of redundancy, having forgotten to look at the root cause issues. This has spawned a whole new industry of itself, which has a financial interest in creating complicated and expensive redundant systems.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: myth-4-big-companies-optimize-better&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Myth 4: Big companies optimize better&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big companies with a certain track record will know better how to optimize as they have more people and resources.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
At first glance, this sounds logical, but in reality, ninety percent of the innovation within the IT space comes from startups. The giant IT companies have a heritage they hardly can overcome. They are locked in old infrastructure designs, and building outside of that infrastructure would be costly, timely, and probably put the breaks on their businesses.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Real innovation gives way to fix the core symptoms rather than taking the problem pain-killer approach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
