&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this agreement, ThreeFold Tech and OpenNebula Systems will set up technical collaboration and joint research on edge computing involving the open-source technology developed as part of the H2020 innovation project ONEedge (2019-2022) and the highly-distributed peer-to-peer edge infrastructure available through the ThreeFold Grid in order to create Edge-as-a-Service environments. Both companies will also seek to integrate additional open-source components developed by ThreeFold Tech and OpenNebula Systems, involving the Linux operating system and the Kubernetes platform for container orchestration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúOpenNebula Systems is seeking to increase the number of cloud&#x2F;edge providers and the associated infrastructure resources available to OpenNebula users through our Provider Catalog,‚Äù said OpenNebula System‚Äôs VP of Open Source Community Relations, Alberto P. Mart√≠. ‚ÄúWe are also exploring with ThreeFold Tech several ways to improve the support of OpenNebula to Linux-based platforms for edge nodes as well as potential enhancement to the integration and support of Kubernetes in OpenNebula, especially for edge deployments.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

		<title>ThreeFold in Paradise</title>
		<published>2022-04-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/paradise-hills/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/paradise-hills/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs January 2022. ThreeFold co-founder Adnan Fatayerji sits in the office of Shaher Mousli, CEO of Paradise Hills Development, along with Suhaib Sheikh, COO of the project. Shaher and Adnan are long-time friends and in fact Shaher gave Adnan his first internship in Dubai about two decades ago, while Adnan was in his final year at university.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaher is well-known in the Dubai real-estate market,  for his open-heartedness and transparency, and has a history of always looking for ways to stand out and differentiate himself and his projects. Paradise Hills in itself came from the idea of creating a ‚Äúparadise‚Äù themed model for residents that could even serve as a tropical resting place for birds in Dubai.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-aha-moment&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-aha-moment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-aha-moment&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past twenty years, Adnan and Shaher have maintained a strong relationship, and on this day, they are gathering to find a way to work together ‚Äì to bring things full circle. They discuss how the real estate market is making a strong comeback, and various types of value propositions for future Paradise Hills residents, when the incredible ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment drops. Instead of a standard one-time gift or fee write-off, why don‚Äôt we add a 3Node to each residence? A gift that keeps on giving! The room is filled with excitement. They realize that a new dawn in the property and homeownership market is born, combining the unified empowerment of digital and physical assets.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;paradise_hills_3node.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paradise Hills 3Node&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, ThreeFold and Paradise Hills will collaborate on a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;news&#x2F;post&#x2F;paradise_hills&#x2F;&quot;&gt;historic partnership&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to create the world‚Äôs first neighborhood cloud network, living on top of the ThreeFold Grid. Dedicated servers called 3Nodes will be installed into 170 homes, providing the edge computing and Internet storage needed to run decentralized applications and Internet services. This will give residents, businesses, developers, and the government a secure and highly-available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally. And homeowners will be rewarded in the form of ThreeFold Tokens (TFT) simply by having these 3Nodes connected.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-time-to-waste&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#no-time-to-waste&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: no-time-to-waste&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;No time to waste&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quickly the team puts the idea to paper, and by February the deal is done. In March, the collaboration is announced and makes the rounds in publications like &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.yahoo.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;paradise-hills-property-development-threefold-090000146.html&quot;&gt;Yahoo! Finance&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and on plenty of regional properties. Adnan even begins training the Paradise Hills sales team on how to present the opportunity to potential residents. The speed of the collaboration is proof of a collective commitment to take this leap of faith, and a high-level of trust in each other and the possibilities. Another big reason for confidence: once the modeling was done, it was clear that this could be a massive financial opportunity for residents, one which could even pay off the cost of the house in a relatively short number of years.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;paradise_hills_connected.png&quot; alt=&quot;Paradise Hills Connected&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ThreeFold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Node&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; will be a standard ‚Äúappliance‚Äù in each Paradise Hills residence, much like a refrigerator or an oven. But this appliance is anything but ‚Äústandard‚Äù ‚Äì it provides and connects decentralized Internet capacity owned by the Paradise Hills community, and comes with an onboarding guide to welcome each resident into the much larger ThreeFold community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, Paradise Hills is adamant about building tools on top of the ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì digital storefronts for local businesses, peer-to-peer marketplaces and forums or chats for the residents, and whatever else is deemed to be needed. The collaboration with ThreeFold essentially turns Paradise Hills into a sovereign ‚Äúsmart‚Äù community, where even the footage from the security cameras on premise can be stored locally and privately.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-community-comes-together&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-community-comes-together&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-community-comes-together&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The community comes together&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to a few weeks ago, the early Paradise Hills community gathers together for a gala. ThreeFold co-founder and tech guru Weynand Kuijpers has the chance to speak in front of the group. He speaks about the early days of the Internet, how it was hijacked by Big Tech turning people into products, and how now there is a new model for the Internet by people, for people. ‚ÄúYou are some of the first to do this,‚Äù he says to the crowd.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;paradise_hills_partners.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Partners of Paradise Hills&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, residents come up and express their excitement, even if they don‚Äôt quite understand all the details. One woman in particular asks, ‚ÄúCan you please explain to me how having this device in my home won‚Äôt impact my privacy or security?‚Äù Adnan goes on to describe how the 3Node is actually there to preserve privacy and security. ‚ÄúA 3Node is just like a solar panel, only instead of electricity, it provides Internet capacity for local usage. In fact, any data that‚Äôs in your home is just a fragment of a piece of a puzzle, so it‚Äôs inaccessible to you or anyone else for that matter.‚Äù Overall, there is a clear feeling that contributing to this new Internet Grid will bring a unifying force to the community, and a deeper sense of meaning for what it means to be a resident of Paradise Hills.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-paradise-to-the-world&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#bringing-paradise-to-the-world&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: bringing-paradise-to-the-world&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Bringing Paradise to the world&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradise Hills is a first of its kind partnership, but it is only the first. We at ThreeFold see incredible opportunities to scale this model across the world, and not only in real estate developments. Imagine if we apply this to lower-income and affordable housing communities, or colleges and universities. Hardware gifted to residents that connect together to form a localized part of a truly sovereign Internet Grid, on top of which useful community tools can be built ‚Äì all while generating passive token rewards for the residents. A ground-up model. A global concept, applied locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Paradise Hills story inspires you, and you have an idea for how to bring this model elsewhere, we invite you to take action. Head to the ThreeFold Forum, create a topic under the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;about-the-paradise-hills-model-category&#x2F;2632&quot;&gt;Paradise Hills Model&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; category, and let‚Äôs spread this to the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Paradise Hills Property Development and ThreeFold to Establish the World‚Äôs First Neighborhood Cloud in Dubai</title>
		<published>2022-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</published>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;DUBAI, United Arab Emirates | Real Estate developer Paradise Hills and ThreeFold have announced today their plans to add dedicated servers (3Nodes) to approximately 170 homes in the Paradise Hill project, creating the world‚Äôs first neighborhood Cloud Network on the ThreeFold Grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this historic partnership, Paradise Hills Development and ThreeFold aim to provide every homeowner of the gated residence with a pre-installed 3Node, a dedicated server that provides the edge computing and internet storage needed to run decentralized applications and internet services. The initiative will provide residents, businesses, developers and the government with a secure and highly available sovereign cloud infrastructure to store and process their data locally.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;.&#x2F;3nodehands.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3Node&quot; &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúParadise Hills is set to become the region‚Äôs center for true decentralization and the future of tomorrow‚Äôs Internet, essentially setting the standard for real estate developments and homeownership globally,‚Äù CEO Shaher Mousli of Paradise Hills Development said about the partnership.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThis historic collaboration is the first pilot in a series of initiatives by ThreeFold to help expand the digital landscape of the United Arab Emirates (UAE),‚Äù says Adnan Fatayerji, co-founder of ThreeFold. ‚ÄúIt will support the development of edge computing, smart cities and IoT, showcasing the power of the private sector to build and drive digital empowerment initiatives in support of the Digital Dubai vision set by the Emirates leadership.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last decade, ‚Äúdata sovereignty‚Äù became a key topic globally, with many countries insisting that any data produced locally should be stored on Internet infrastructures within their borders. By bringing ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized Internet infrastructure to real estate properties such as Paradise Hills, the UAE will be home to the first-of-its-kind, self-sovereign, smart city development in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThrough simple, secure, and scalable technology, ThreeFold empowers millions to invent and explore new experiences,‚Äù added ThreeFold co-founder Kristof de Spiegeleer. ‚ÄúWe want to empower local businesses, creators, and communities to build a more sustainable and inclusive future.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You and your communities can participate in the expansion and interconnection of the decentralized Internet as well!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to make a password-free Internet for one dollar owned by data smallholders? How to overcome the digital divide and reclaim the Internet from big tech?&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Why is ThreeFold P2P Cloud the better solution for customers than Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure?</title>
		<published>2021-10-12T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-10-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-cloud-vs-centralized-providers-like-aws-azure/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/threefold-cloud-vs-centralized-providers-like-aws-azure/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we‚Äôve recently been exploring decentralized &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;project_comparison_1_dfinity&#x2F;&quot;&gt;projects&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to see where ThreeFold is in the space and where we stand out, we thought it‚Äôs a good time to also look into how we compare to traditional, centralized cloud providers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud market is a highly complex and competitive one, currently &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.srgresearch.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly&quot;&gt;dominated&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; by the market leaders Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure who account for more than half of the worldwide cloud revenues. This centralized nature of today‚Äôs cloud as well as its hyper-scale data center model are the cause for various issues, ranging from the monopolistic power of the few big market players and vendor lock-in effects to the incredibly high energy consumption of data centers and the limited scalability of the current model. Moreover, traditional data centers are more prone to outages and cyber attacks. We believe the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; built by independent farmers around the globe and our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; provide a solution to all of these issues.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While centralized cloud providers do offer some benefits, such as robust feature sets and huge customer service teams, there are a few key and important differences we think any customer would care about:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest and most obvious difference. Today, big tech holds a &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.srgresearch.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-and-microsoft-maintain-their-grip-market-others-are-also-growing-rapidly&quot;&gt;monopoly&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on the Internet and Cloud markets, meaning they somehow became the gatekeepers of what was originally intended to be a distributed, neutral Internet. When using AWS or Google Cloud, the data is stored in centralized data centers owned by private corporations. These data centers are susceptible to hacking and outages that can take down massive chunks of the Internet. In this system, people have become products, as they exchange their &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;data_leaks&#x2F;&quot;&gt;data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for ‚Äúfree‚Äù online experiences. With &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;mission&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, data is stored fully decentralized on the peer-to-peer ThreeFold Grid, where the physical hardware is owned by independent ThreeFold &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;Farmers&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, and the data is owned by as well as only accessible to the person(s) who put it there. So, hackers can‚Äôt get in and due to the decentralized nature of the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;grid&quot;&gt;ThreeFold Grid&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, large-scale outages would be much less likely as well. Further, no organization or entity needs to be trusted and people are not treated as products ‚Äì with ThreeFold‚Äôs infrastructure, the Internet is owned &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tf_grid_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;by the people&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: limitless-scalability-at-the-edge&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Limitless Scalability at the Edge&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lightweight operating system &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;zero-os&quot;&gt;Zero-OS&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; makes it possible and even easy to install a node close to where the data is being consumed. There is no need for large servers, nor for heavy power supply installations. Together with our hardware partners, we‚Äôre offering &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;farm&quot;&gt;3Nodes&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; with plug-and-play functionalities, allowing &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;join_the_peoples_internet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;anyone to participate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This makes our model infinitely scalable at the edge. Hyper-scale data centers are not able to provide these levels of scalability and edge benefits. In order to scale their operations, centralized cloud providers need to build more data centers and take care of the related maintenance which takes time and costs billions. The traditional data center model also isn‚Äôt well suited for the edge, as this requires flexibility and close proximity to the respective data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Security&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centralized clouds are secure, but vulnerable. At ThreeFold, we pride ourselves on the levels of security we‚Äôre providing. The &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;tech&#x2F;peer-to-peer&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; nature of our technology means end-to-end transmission of data between parties (with no middlemen). This is a big one: Nothing is being stored or copied in central servers. Moreover, ThreeFold‚Äôs self-driving and self-healing IT removes the need for human intervention and eliminates the many back doors present in current architecture. So, &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;critical-security-updates-for-apple-and-google-underline-need-for-secure-it-ecosystem&#x2F;1271&quot;&gt;security issues&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; caused by human error and hacking possibilities both diminish greatly. In addition to that, there is the distributed storage algorithm which makes it nearly impossible for data to be lost. And much more. You can find more info on our &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;threefold__usp_secure?id=network-security&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; or in this &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;security-privacy-on-the-threefold-grid-and-second-best-alternatives-out-there-today&#x2F;1290&quot;&gt;forum post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;privacy&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#privacy&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: privacy&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Privacy&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that you &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;threefold_data_sovereignty&#x2F;&quot;&gt;own your data&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and nobody ‚Äì not even us ‚Äì can get access to it is key to making ThreeFold much more private than centralized cloud providers. On top of that, connections within our global overlay network, the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.threefold.io&#x2F;t&#x2F;how-our-planetary-network-works&#x2F;1210&quot;&gt;Planetary Network&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, are peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the centralized cloud is quite expensive, whereas our ThreeFold P2P Cloud is much more cost-effective. Learn more about this in our cloud pricing comparison &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;tfgrid&#x2F;pricing&#x2F;threefold__cloud_pricing_compare&quot;&gt;here&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While electricity for storing and transporting data, administration, human resources, and even gas (to transport physical data-holding devices) lead to a very high energy consumption, our dispersed storage model and peer-to-peer infrastructure allow for &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;threefold#&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;threefold__energy_savings_storage&quot;&gt;significant energy savings&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. So, another big difference between ThreeFold and centralized cloud providers is that we‚Äôre up to 100x more &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;new.threefold.io&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;for_our_planet&#x2F;&quot;&gt;energy-efficient&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold allows people to host their own applications anywhere on their decentralized cloud infrastructure via smart contract. This provides a powerful solution for ownCloud users to host their collaboration tools anywhere they want, independently from conventional, centralized cloud providers, and without having to maintain the servers and software themselves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;free-from-censorship-and-user-tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#free-from-censorship-and-user-tracking&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: free-from-censorship-and-user-tracking&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Free from censorship and user tracking&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ownCloud can be installed anywhere, providing a secure and sovereign alternative to public cloud providers ‚Äã‚Äãfor more than 200 million users worldwide as of today.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ownCloud running on the ThreeFold Grid infrastructure, users can manage their ‚Äúown‚Äù cloud on a neutral cloud infrastructure that is free from censorship, user tracking and privacy breaches. This is made possible by Zero-OS, ThreeFold‚Äôs stateless and lightweight operating system that allows servers to run autonomously.

&lt;p&gt;ownCloud and ThreeFold have a history of delivering technical collaborations amongst various projects. While ownCloud excels at delivering secure and private collaboration platforms, ThreeFold offers a robust and flexible large-scale cloud layer. Combining both projects provides new possibilities in regards to governance, reliability and security for users and their data. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the highly anticipated 3rd release of ThreeFold‚Äôs technology expected to launch this quarter, &lt;strong&gt;ownCloud and ThreeFold are preparing a pilot program&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; to leverage their infrastructure and software expertise to deliver truly self-sovereign collaboration solutions in the world. ownCloud and ThreeFold are currently working out the details of their pilot program, which will be announced at a future date.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the two are &lt;strong&gt;planning a cross-community event&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, where community members can learn more about the two technologies and hear further details about the collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is developing a peer-to-peer internet platform that aims to liberalize what it labels as a centralized and unequally distributed internet. Its platform, called the ThreeFold Grid, comprises over +1000 servers in 50+ different countries around the world, delivering approximately 80 PB in storage and over 22,000 CPU cores worldwide, making it the largest storage and compute peer-to-peer internet network in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each server runs ThreeFold‚Äôs stateless and lightweight open-source operating system, Zero-OS, and is set up and operated by independent individuals and organisations called Farmers. Farmers earn rewards in TFT - the platform‚Äôs native token - for their participation. TFT is the currency of the ThreeFold Grid, with each token representing a unit of storage and compute on the platform. Grid users can use these tokens to reserve the storage and compute they need to store, build and share on the platform‚Äôs internet network.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Art &amp; Culture in VR: Coming to the ThreeFold Grid</title>
		<published>2021-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2021-08-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link href="https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/artheon-blog-one/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/artheon-blog-one/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year at a ThreeFold gathering, a few of us on the team had the pleasure to meet a man named Vasily, a creative mind with a big heart and proud founder of Artheon.¬†Artheon, in its essence, was a virtual reality museum experience focused on bringing fine art and culture from around the world directly to people. The concept was immediately captivating, and the demo brought it to life for us. The graphics were already solid, and being able to walk around a museum and interact with the artwork was a unique experience to say the least. We¬†talked about the implications and his greater vision around access and education, and it was very clear we needed to partner up. Not long after, Artheon and ThreeFold joined forces.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-partnership-all-about&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-the-partnership-all-about&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-the-partnership-all-about&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is the partnership all about?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with ThreeFold, Artheon aims to create the world‚Äôs largest open art database ‚Äì made for everyone, and owned by everyone. We will provide access to art and cultural heritage to people around the world, without borders. Not just access, but a high-quality and high-resolution virtual reality experience where people can really immerse themselves in their surrounding environment. With Artheon, people can now even touch and hold paintings or artifacts, something that would clearly not be possible in real life. And while today, only a select few (relative to the total global population) have the opportunity to travel and to experience museums and cultural &amp;amp; sacred sites, Artheon will change that!
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
It‚Äôs not only about experience, though, it‚Äôs also about community and education and providing a more equal access to art and cultural objects.¬†We‚Äôll bring together a global community of museums, artists, and art seekers who can not only enjoy, but also teach and learn about the art and cultural objects housed within the Artheon universe. For Artheon, it‚Äôs imperative
that people are able to access information about the artists and the art itself, and then make and share their own perceptions as well. No need or pressure to follow the direction of the current system‚Äôs ideology. This is a different angle from how we traditionally learn at school, where narrow or accepted views and concepts are imposed upon us. A key aim of Artheon is to bring different perspectives through collective, participatory, and experiental¬†teaching and learning.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Looking ahead, the vision is that people will be able to create their own virtual spaces and expose them on Artheon. They can create something from scratch or even re-imagine a historical site as it was long ago and share it with the community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-threefold-benefit-artheon&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-does-threefold-benefit-artheon&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-does-threefold-benefit-artheon&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;How does ThreeFold benefit Artheon?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start, there was a clear connection between Artheon and ThreeFold from a vision, values, and ethos perspective. But there are also some more specific reasons why Artheon chose and benefits from ThreeFold, which mainly revolve around the decentralized nature of the ThreeFold Grid.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR)¬†provide significant benefits to our new digital reality. These technologies open new ways of sharing information¬†in areas such as¬†the arts in the case of Artheon,¬†allowing for upgraded¬†and immersive experiences for users.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Decentralized clouds have been associated with the promise of new digital applications and services that come with a hyper-connected life.¬†Because the graphics of VR&#x2F;AR experiences require heavy rendering, on-device processes are augmented by splitting workloads between the VR&#x2F;AR device and a decentralized cloud. So, graphics rendering on a decentralized cloud like what the ThreeFold Grid provides would be significantly improved by achieving a much¬†lower latency.¬†Another advantage of the ThreeFold Grid is that it provides an extremely high level of security and privacy, empowering Artheon and its users with real data sovereignty.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
And finally, Artheon experienced an unfortunate event earlier this summer where their servers suffered from an intense heat wave and essentially burned up. There was no backup, and this would have been catastrophic in the scenario of them having millions of users. Good thing¬†they aren‚Äôt live yet, but this is a great example of how centralized models fail. With a decentralized infrastructure like ThreeFold, this type of situation would not have occured, as data would be hosted on many locations.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So, by distributing the computing power closer to their users, a VR experience such as Artheon would not only improve their latency speed, security, and privacy, but also the resilience of their business model.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-status-of-artheon-and-its-partnership-with-threefold&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-the-status-of-artheon-and-its-partnership-with-threefold&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-the-status-of-artheon-and-its-partnership-with-threefold&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is the status of Artheon (and its partnership with ThreeFold)?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Artheon has been making incredible improvements to the graphics and experience, and adding as many new pieces of art as possible into the universe. As you can imagine, the possibilities really are endless, but here are some of the milestones planned for the rest of this year:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning to add partial DLC (downloadable content) support and photogrammetry-scanned locations for users to experience&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New UI for desktop (Windows, MacOS, Linux)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementation of desired social features such as follower and friend system&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will be able to see who of their friends or people they follow are online¬†‚Äì from that, they can connect to a server and join them to share experiences together&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will also be able to see how many people are online at the moment and where they are located on the globe (if permissions are allowed)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the possibility for museums to host free or closed paid exhibitions&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artheon will be hosted on the ThreeFold Grid!
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-you-do-now-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-can-you-do-now-to-get-involved&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-can-you-do-now-to-get-involved&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What can you do now to get involved?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/newsroom/threefold-zetako/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For both Zetako and ThreeFold, efficiency and sustainability are key. &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zetako.ai&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Zetako&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a company dedicated to lossless data compression, and after years of research and development, has created an alternative solution to the regular standards of data compression. And with two decades of relevant experience and a focus on sustainability, ThreeFold has built new peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure and technologies from the ground up ‚Äì where every aspect is optimized towards maximum efficiency and the least amount of harm to the planet.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both already members of &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;aci&quot;&gt;the Alliance for a Conscious Internet&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, a planetary movement of people and organizations that take action to shape a conscious digital world, Zetako and ThreeFold have now signed on to merge their technologies to bring forward hyper-efficient, secure, and private data transport and storage solutions for all.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúThe world has been using the same compression technology for the last 30 years, just like the model to deliver IT services has not changed,‚Äù says Weynand Kuijpers, ThreeFold Co-Founder. ‚ÄúThreeFold challenges that status quo, where anybody can now be¬†the Internet by adding capacity to the ThreeFold Grid ‚Äì and with this, we need a 21st century compression and decompression technology.¬†Zetako delivers that much-needed true innovation.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold Grid is live today, the world‚Äôs most advanced peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure. It can scale limitlessly, and brings a more performant, secure and sustainable Internet to host humanity‚Äôs data and workloads. ThreeFold technology already consumes 90 percent less energy than today‚Äôs solutions.¬†(The company has also recently announced plans to offset energy usage 100 percent by the end of 2021, with the goal of taking two times more carbon out of the air than they put in.)
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
With its quantum safe storage offering, ThreeFold can now integrate with Zetako‚Äôs technology to store compressed data, enabling it to become even more efficient and sustainable. Further, ThreeFold can now do compression live on network connections between different parts of what users deploy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúWe are particularly excited about the opportunity to work with ThreeFold as we believe they represent the future of data transmission &amp;amp; storage,‚Äù says Claus Rosenberg Gotthard, CEO of Zetako. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the right place to implement Zetako‚Äôs innovative technologies of bit-by-bit compression.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the short term, Zetako and ThreeFold will work on a project basis to fulfill specific organization requirements. Zetako provides the compression, and ThreeFold provides the compute and storage. As an example, with COVID-19 and the world moving increasingly digital, congesting the network, people and businesses that need a way to transfer large files quickly will now have a much more efficient way to do so. And in the longer term, the two will explore more ways to deeply integrate their technologies and provide broader solutions to the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-zetako&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-zetako&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-zetako&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About Zetako&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zetako is dedicated to reducing energy usage &amp;amp; CO2 emission for the transmission &amp;amp; storage of data by applying a new¬†more efficient lossless data compression technology.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We have developed a new mathematical theory based on Statistical Predictive modeling and applied this to a new lossless data compression technology. The result is a technology that provides higher Compression at higher Speed and uses &amp;gt;70% less energy in the process. In addition to this, the technology is capable of doing bit-by-bit compression allowing for real time bandwidth reduction. The technology does not need a prior knowledge of the dataset to start compression. This means that our technology does not require the data stream to be chopped up into chunks ‚Äì we apply compression the moment the first bit (1 or 0) comes in.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CasperLabs and ThreeFold have a shared belief that decentralization is needed in order to build a better tomorrow. According to &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;casperlabs.io&#x2F;en&#x2F;company&quot;&gt;CasperLabs&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, decentralization is ‚Äúhow we will create more open, transparent, permissionless networks powered by people ‚Äî paving the way for a new era of equitable innovation.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, ThreeFold is thrilled to announce a collaborative partnership with CasperLabs. Together, we will further CasperLabs‚Äô decentralization efforts while accelerating a collective mission and vision of more equally distributing global wealth and resources ‚Äì doing so through creating more opportunity for people and enterprises around the world, without limits.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThreeFold and CasperLabs share a commitment to making web3 environments more accessible to all developers,‚Äù says Neil Kapoor of CasperLabs. ‚ÄúNow that Casper is live on mainnet, we look forward to collaborating with ThreeFold to deliver a truly scalable, secure and decentralized IT infrastructure for enterprise organizations building innovative, blockchain-based solutions.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the partnership, developers and enterprises building on top of Casper technology will be able to choose to run on ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&#x2F;cloud&quot;&gt;Peer-to-Peer Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for storage and compute resources.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Privacy and decentralization are some of the values shared by both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.presearch.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Presearch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, at the core of their missions to create scalable technologies that can positively impact the lives of millions of individuals and enterprises around the globe.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch and ThreeFold are thrilled to officially announce their collaborative partnership. Presearch is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearch.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a community-powered, decentralized search engine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that provides better results while protecting your privacy and rewarding you when you search. And ThreeFold is the world‚Äôs largest peer-to-peer cloud, bringing privacy and security, cost-efficiencies, ease-of-use, and true IT decentralization to the market.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch (and its node and storage infrastructure) will benefit from ThreeFold‚Äôs peer-to-peer cloud in two different ways:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;1. Powering Presearch node operators with a decentralized cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Presearch community will be able to deploy their Presearch nodes in a few clicks in a completely decentralized cloud infrastructure, using the ThreeFold peer-to-peer cloud and its developer tools. Thus, they can escape the monopolies of centralized cloud providers, and reduce the technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Colin Pape, Presearch‚Äôs CEO, said in a statement, ‚ÄúWe are excited to partner with the ThreeFold team to offer our community members an easy way to quickly deploy Presearch Nodes on ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid, the world‚Äôs largest server network powered by blockchain technology.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch has recently opened its beta testing program for node operators looking to become part of the revolutionary network that is changing the way individuals around the world can search the web ‚Äì in a significantly more private, inclusive, and rewarding environment. Anyone who believes in the decentralization of search engines should &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearchcommunity.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;UkDumktm&quot;&gt;sign up to their beta testers list&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and get in touch with Presearch to be one of the early adopters. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;2. Leveraging ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized storage to store the future of the search engine experience&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presearch and ThreeFold are exploring the usage of ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized storage capacity to store and archive Presearch‚Äôs indexes and other data running the search engine. The main goal is to provide an unbreakable data storage and backup infrastructure for the future of the search engine experience that the top-notch team behind Presearch is building.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition, ThreeFold looks forward to advocating for Presearch and integrating the decentralized search engine into its current and future solutions for a more private and inclusive internet experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Powering the ThreeFold community‚Äôs search engine experience with Presearch&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold will be establishing Presearch‚Äôs decentralized search engine as its main search engine partner, advocating for its usage within its growing community of developers, cloud capacity farmers, enterprises, and users. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As stated by Weynand Kuijpers, ‚ÄúPresearch is creating a search engine by people for people. The internet has moved from data sharing to centralized data harvesting. Presearch is undoing that by creating user control over data stored, presenting a (digital) return for contributing to the system and improving search results, and making it decentralized. ThreeFold is looking forward to co-creating a decentralized mechanism where the search engine is broken down and operates everywhere, and users are in control of their own identity and data.‚Äú
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
More to come as the partnership develops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-presearch&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About Presearch:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are tired of Big Tech companies dominating the internet, censoring content and controlling the social narrative by manipulating information to fit an agenda. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch provides improved access to information and increased search choice with its community-driven search engine that leverages blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to empower and reward users. More than 1.6 million people have already joined the service.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In 2020, Presearch launched its innovative keyword staking sponsorship platform that enables promoters to lock their Presearch PRE cryptocurrency tokens against different keywords in order to have their promotional ads displayed. More than 60 million PRE tokens have already been locked.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Now Presearch is launching a decentralized search engine that rewards node operators with PRE tokens when they run Presearch nodes. Through its partnership with ThreeFold, anyone will be able to easily launch a Presearch node running on the ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid with no technical knowledge required.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.harmony.one&quot;&gt;Harmony&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Its protocol has achieved secure and random state sharding, being the first sharded Proof of Stake on production. Harmony‚Äôs Mainnet supports thousands of nodes in multiple shards, producing blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The network‚Äôs staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing. Harmony aims to build an open network of nodes operated and governed by a large community. Harmony has designed a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism for network security and economics - Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) which reduces centralization and distributes rewards fairly to thousands of validators.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dubai, UAE. Today at GITEX Technology Week, ThreeFold signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to cooperate in the CEEMA region on the implementation of a decentralized grid of computing and storage capacity, which enables a neutral, low cost and low energy internet on a global scale.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
HPE provides their clients in the CEEMA region with the option to connect their computing and storage capacity to ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized grid that supports ThreeFold‚Äôs mission to provide a Responsible Internet, accessible to all.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
HPE server and storage hardware has been certified to be used on ThreeFold‚Äôs Grid and HPE plans to build services to support the growth and usage of ThreeFold‚Äôs Grid which is in line with their edge cloud and blockchain strategy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold launched a Responsible Internet capacity platform (on March 2018) with the support and collaboration from its community, and has already achieved sizable deployments of decentralized internet compute and storage capacity across the globe. ThreeFold‚Äôs open source and localized IT capacity encourage developers; as a result of cost and performance efficiencies, to build all types of decentralized applications on its network to promote the expansion of a new digital responsible economy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúThis is a monumental step towards a new responsible internet and empowering a new digital economy‚Äú, Kristof De Spiegeleer, Visionary Co-Founder of ThreeFold.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThreeFold has created one of the smartest Blockchain solutions we have come across‚Äù, said Johannes Koch: Vice President and HPE CEEMA Managing Director. ‚ÄúWe are excited about our future cooperation‚Äù.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
