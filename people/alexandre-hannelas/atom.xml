&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth is more than the accumulation of money and resources. It can be generated in ways other than through conventional financial means. The financial justice warrior, Bernard Liataer, highlighted that to capture the wealth of our societies, our culture and our environments, we have to pay heed to the notion of wealth as well-being.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we obtain that well-being? We all know the answer to this question ‚Äì we have a sense of well-being when all of our needs are met. It is not just the basic needs of food, clothing and shelter but also the need to be a creative participant in our community, have a voice in our own destiny, and pursue our own spiritual development unhindered by social sanction. Developing real wealth implies making choices that enable all members of the community to attain well-being. Achieving sustainable wealth implies meeting the present‚Äôs needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Twin has been created while taking into consideration the different types of community capital that need to be achieved to create real wealth:¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural Capital - It includes the community environment that produces more assets. Our today‚Äôs economies failed to measure, understand and account for the true value of nature‚Äôs riches - clean air and water, soil and pollination for food, the social, intrinsic and spiritual values of natural beauty. Digital Twin will be the tool for us to place a proper value on Natural capital finally.¬†&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological Capital ‚Äì It includes how we harness our intellectual resources to create tools, systems, machines, arts, skills, and materials designed to improve our lives. This is what Digital Twin is all about - providing the required technology to enhance our lives and those of our communities‚Äô members through collective efforts and intelligence. Digital Twin is only the foundation for this future global well-being. People will support education and creativity throughout the world and give access to material information¬†required to create additional innovative technologies.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Capital ‚Äì It recognizes the economic importance of all the ways we are connected: the relationships, our networks and values we share and the cooperative systems, and all its different components we use for interacting. Nowadays, our social capital is threatened through the repetitive act of violence, betrayal of trust, exclusion or less sharing and caring towards our fellow humans. Digital Twin has been created to encourage the easy sharing and exchange of resources and cooperate with each other on a platform.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical and Cultural Capital ‚Äì Through history, we have learned, and now we are transmitting our cultural understanding and recommendation about the economic and financial system to others through an open-source, public and transparent peer-to-peer exchange protocol.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Capital ‚Äì It includes all capabilities that people have to learn, invent, create, work, care for each other, and contribute to the community. This is the reason why Digital Twin has been created - A project to benefit us all.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Capital ‚Äì It is the creation of real wealth through the availability of liquidity resources through a multi-currency system and Savings &amp;amp; Investments made by individuals and institutions. By strengthening and increasing this type of capital, our peer-to-peer platform believes that it is the obvious path to a successful economic development.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these forms of capital produce the critical flows of assets through the economic system. Capital is the foundation, the reproductive system, the greenhouse that grows a healthy economy. This has been one of the fundamental beliefs of Digital Twin - For the well-being of worldwide communities.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<id>https://threefoldfoundation.github.io/www_threefold_io/blog/actually-you-are-the-product/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;actually-you-are-the-product&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#actually-you-are-the-product&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: actually-you-are-the-product&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Actually, you are the product&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever with this global pandemic happening since late 2019, our lives are being shaped by our interaction with the digital world - work meetings on Zoom followed by Skype or Messenger Video Call with your family before a quick run with your favourite running app and a google search for your next meal. Technologies and services offer us a lot and greatly improve our daily lives. But what‚Äôs the real cost of these tools we rely on so much?¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies, especially those offering free services, collect data about you. It might be data you knowingly and willingly share to enjoy the benefits of the service (name, age, email address,..) or data that you might not realize you are sharing, like your approximate location through your IP address or your social network identifier or apps accessing your contacts.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some of this data, and its collection, may appear harmless to some, what happens behind the scenes is a real source of concern as the data collection is only the first step in a long and opaque process. Adtech companies combine this information and create an assumed picture of you that we may call a digital doppelganger - Your ‚Äúdigital secret identity‚Äù. Actually, you may have hundreds or thousands of different doppelgangers held¬†by companies you‚Äôve never heard of.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data are so valuable that big tech giants spend so much time and effort building the platform that is useful for us and giving those platforms to us for free. Well, this data is collected for a single purpose: to better predict your behaviour and target you with ads.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real example:¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a person who has never talked about their political views online, never shared anything related to politics, never donated any money and never mentioned anything even in their private emails. Now the algorithms models that had been developed can analyse his&#x2F;her Facebook likes or the music he&#x2F;she listen to and with high accuracy can predict their political affiliation, and then being the target of unnecessary ads.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: This is not only for political affiliation. It stands out for every products and service¬†using these marketing tools.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology isn‚Äôt just hardware and software; it‚Äôs a fundamental component of every aspect of our lives and society. Inventions need to be created with social impact in mind. The invention should not be driven solely by profit, and the long-term effects should not be ignored¬†and unknowable.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not paying for it, you are not the customer. You are the product being sold. It‚Äôs a powerful phrase, a modern dialogue to get people rethinking their relationship to social media.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Digital Twin, regain your freedom where you will live your digital life securely and privately. Now, you will have one and unique digital identity to¬†interact in human-to-human way with your peers, edit, manage and store your documents, publish your web and make automatic payments.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Digital Twin, only you own your data and no one else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-should-i-care&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-should-i-care&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-should-i-care&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Why should I care?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you remember when you could create your own safe space and decide what others see and know?¬†Now, whether you are at home, in the middle of a city, or hiking a mountain, you‚Äôre never really alone.¬†More and more, the technology we used is connected to the internet. Cars, fridges, energy meters, even baby monitors send out data about you and your family 24&#x2F;7 beyond your control.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;behind-the-scene&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#behind-the-scene&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: behind-the-scene&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Behind the scene&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data is collected for spurious purposes: to better predict your behaviour and target you with ads. The targeted advertising ecosystem, using trackers included in the sites you visit and Software Development Kits (SDKs) in the apps you use, aims to get a better picture of you to present you with more relevant ads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. The ad tech¬†ecosystem has one main feature: connecting companies to you through an opaque and technically complex infrastructure, allowing almost anyone to enter the data collection and exchange market. Moreover, this means any companies can participate in processes such as Real-Time Bidding (an¬†automated process that enables advertisers to target particular groups of people on different websites, videos, apps without having to negotiate prices directly), only to collect data and never display ads.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that companies, such as two AdTech companies that track your activities on a different set of sites, can grab data from each other to consolidate the data and profiles they have on people. Consequently, companies participating in this ecosystem (or sometimes on their own) can sell your data to clients that may not be using it to try and sell you stuff. This is the unhealthy and unsustainable digital cycle that we live in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these examples, it is not hard to imagine that your personal data can be used to influence the price of products and services proposed to¬†you, particularly from companies and institutions.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs join forces together and, as a community, reclaim our freedom and get back ownership of your data. With Digital Twin, you are at the centre¬†of your digital world. No one else.¬†&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
