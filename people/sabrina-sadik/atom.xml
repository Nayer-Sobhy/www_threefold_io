&lt;p&gt;During a gathering with some friends, I noticed something that made me think about how important it is what we‚Äôre doing at ThreeFold.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
One of my friends was complaining about how he couldn‚Äôt log in to one of his social media platforms, because all of his passwords are different and he forgot which one he used for this particular platform. Another friend was saying how she tagged her sister on a funny meme, but her sister couldn‚Äôt find it on Facebook. Turns out she tagged her on Instagram. And then one of them said something that I keep hearing more and more from people, ‚ÄúWhy do we have so many apps, I can‚Äôt find anything anymore!‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We exist so many times online, but why? There is only one me in the real world. Why should there not be only one me online? Why should I have 25 different profiles on 25 different platforms, with 25 different logins, when I am unique?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
That is another dilemma that ThreeFold has a solution for, with its autonomous technology. 3Bot - a digital avatar like no other, that basically handles your entire online life. The focus lies on digital privacy, where only you can access your data, and no one else. The 3Bot has all the functionalities you need to interact and exchange information and value, there will be no need for that many applications on your device anymore. With 3Bot, everything changes.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The 3Bot is built on the ThreeFold Grid, and has the same values as ThreeFold. Freedom, Equality, and Sustainability. It is important that your data is safe, and what can be safer than you being the only one who not only has access to it, but also the only one who owns that data? Your online world should not be that different from your offline world. In your offline world, you are the center of your own life. That is what ThreeFold is doing with the 3Bot, putting you in the center of your online life, too.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
One decentralized application, one digital wallet, one login and one you. Because you‚Äôre unique.

		<title>An escape from the Great Hack</title>

&lt;p&gt;Have you seen ‚ÄòThe Great Hack‚Äô on Netflix? It‚Äôs a documentary about the Cambridge Analytica hacking scandal, where personal data of millions of peoples‚Äô Facebook profiles were harvested without their consent and used for political advertising purposes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
While watching it, I couldn‚Äôt help but think how unfair it is that in today‚Äôs digital society, people are being treated like products, because there is no such thing as a ‚Äòfree‚Äô platform without YOU being the product. What did reassure me, is that people are sick of having their data used this way. But what they might not know, is that the internet problem is bigger than ‚Äòjust‚Äô data protection.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The Internet is growing at an exponential rate. To service this demand, a few large companies (Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Facebook, etc.) have built and continue to build supersized, power-hungry and centralized data centers. These data centers make up the majority of all Internet capacity available today. However, the Internet is expanding much faster than datacenters and the planet can cope with. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition to that, the Internet is extremely centralized, with most of these data centers being located in the US. Think of it like electricity. If consumers in, for example, Turkey had to use electricity generated in the US, it would be too expensive and inefficient, because it is too far away. The transmission lines would be too strained and losses and repairs would make it unsustainable. Capacity is like electricity. When centralized, it becomes too expensive and wasteful for remote users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-what-is-the-solution-to-these-problems&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So what is the solution to these problems?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Internet needs to be more distributed, cost-effective, neutral, and sustainable. ThreeFold has developed such a new technology, the ThreeFold Grid (Grid) and a token which enables all this to happen.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Combining the values of the ThreeFold Foundation (freedom, equality and fairness) with the technology developed by TFTech (Zero-OS, Zero-Chain, 3Bot) and a digital currency called the ThreeFold Token (a decentralized digital currency and means of payment to exchange autonomous and decentralized Internet services)  we believe that we have all the tools in order to actually make a difference in tomorrow‚Äôs digital world. Question is, are you ready to join us?

		<title>ThreeFold partners with Hewlett Packard Enterprise</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dubai, UAE. Today at GITEX Technology Week, ThreeFold signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to cooperate in the CEEMA region on the implementation of a decentralized grid of computing and storage capacity, which enables a neutral, low cost and low energy internet on a global scale.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
HPE provides their clients in the CEEMA region with the option to connect their computing and storage capacity to ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized grid that supports ThreeFold‚Äôs mission to provide a Responsible Internet, accessible to all.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
HPE server and storage hardware has been certified to be used on ThreeFold‚Äôs Grid and HPE plans to build services to support the growth and usage of ThreeFold‚Äôs Grid which is in line with their edge cloud and blockchain strategy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold launched a Responsible Internet capacity platform (on March 2018) with the support and collaboration from its community, and has already achieved sizable deployments of decentralized internet compute and storage capacity across the globe. ThreeFold‚Äôs open source and localized IT capacity encourage developers; as a result of cost and performance efficiencies, to build all types of decentralized applications on its network to promote the expansion of a new digital responsible economy.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
‚ÄúThis is a monumental step towards a new responsible internet and empowering a new digital economy‚Äú, Kristof De Spiegeleer, Visionary Co-Founder of ThreeFold.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThreeFold has created one of the smartest Blockchain solutions we have come across‚Äù, said Johannes Koch: Vice President and HPE CEEMA Managing Director. ‚ÄúWe are excited about our future cooperation‚Äù.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold is focused on democratizing internet compute and storage capacity to enable a responsible internet for all. Open source software empowers people to create neutral, green and private capacity for people across the globe that‚Äôs blockchain driven and 100% decentralized. (threefold.io)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
