		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, that‚Äôs right. With ThreeFold, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;¬†become the Internet! Let me quickly explain.¬†
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today‚Äôs Internet is powered by hyper-scale data centers which are owned by large corporations. With +80% of the global infrastructure and +60% of the global Internet networks owned by a bunch of companies, the Internet became a real business with us humans being the products of that business model.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold creates an entirely new Internet economy that is owned by all of us and makes the traditional cloud model of building data centers obsolete. With ThreeFold,¬†independent people called ‚ÄúFarmers‚Äù plug in 3Nodes (hardware) from their homes or offices anywhere around the world. And they earn income for it. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Together, they power a new, data-sovereign, and planet-positive Internet owned and powered by the people. This is a game-changer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: so-how-do-i-get-a-3node&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;So, how do I get a 3Node?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can buy one of the ready-made nodes¬†from cooperatives around the world.¬†This is a good and very easy way to support the ThreeFold project and to ‚ÄúBE THE INTERNET.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today you can buy a 3Node via our website. We are also working with our farming cooperatives to decentralize the provisioning and distribution of hardware to a glocal approach (a global network of local networks).¬†
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
But what if 3Nodes are not immediately available?¬†For example, last week we had a huge influx of orders for our Titan V2 3Nodes and sold out the entire batch with 3,000 extra orders. We‚Äôre now talking with many hardware distributors to make sure we can satsify all these orders, but this could take a while.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So if you are a little bit more adventurous, and want to build your 3Node from the ground up, yourself, here‚Äôs how to do it:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
To ‚Äúbecome the Internet‚Äù is fairly simple (but does take some technical knowledge and effort).¬†Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A computer with an INTEL or AMD brain, some memory, and some storage cabilities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A smartphone on which you can download and run the ‚ÄúThreeFold Connect‚Äù app.¬†This will provide you with a wallet (to receive your farmed TFT and to pay a very small amount of TFT to get started).&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A laptop &#x2F; desktop (and USB stick) to launch your online 3Bot, configure your farm, download your bootloader and burn the bootloader to a USB stick.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some technical knowledge, interest and 45 minutes of time.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still here and reading, we‚Äôre good to go! I go through the whole process¬†in a 3-minute video which will give you a quick overview of how to set up your farm. (Click through to the video on YouTube and find helpful links in the description.)

&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Today, the global Internet and IT infrastructure requires enormous amounts of energy, responsible for about 10% of annual global energy consumption. This makes the IT industry amongst the most pollutive industries in the world (along with the often-discussed airline industry, for comparison).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe IT can be sustainable. Actually, it should be! That&#x27;s why energy efficiency has always been a key focus of ours. With climate change and sustainability as some of the most pressing issues of our times, new green solutions need to be our priority. It has been key to ThreeFold since the very beginning of its story to enable a technological infrastructure that can reduce the Internet‚Äôs carbon footprint drastically. 
&lt;h2 id=&quot;simplicity-is-the-key-to-unlock-a-better-future&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#simplicity-is-the-key-to-unlock-a-better-future&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: simplicity-is-the-key-to-unlock-a-better-future&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Simplicity is the key to unlock a better future&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, integration suites, middleware solutions, and enterprise service busses have been invented and implemented to cover integration challenges within the current internet. This has further complicated IT architectures, resulting in a loss of actual end user workload performance.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
ThreeFold reworked the whole approach to IT architectures and eliminated the layers of complexity. The result is a cloud stack that presents minimal overhead and that requires less hardware ‚Äì reducing heat generation and eventually cooling requirements. By reducing the need for power, the net result is an energy-efficient Internet grid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;improving-resilience-and-efficiency-through-self-healing-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#improving-resilience-and-efficiency-through-self-healing-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: improving-resilience-and-efficiency-through-self-healing-it&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Improving resilience and efficiency through Self-Healing IT&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping systems up and running is a major requirement in modern day IT. Leading vendors earn most of their margin by selling maintenance contracts, performance guarantees, and professional services. Their business models bring no incentive to make things simple and efficient for consumers.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Creating a self-healing environment requires only minimal manual intervention to replace broken hardware components. Broken hardware components are inevitable, and the Zero-OS distributed node architecture deals with such failures by turning off broken components and provisioning unused capacity. By removing the need to ship broken parts back and forth, and linking to the corresponding installation knowledge (engineers), a lower carbon footprint can be achieved.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-painkiller-approach-we-tackle-the-root-issue&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#no-painkiller-approach-we-tackle-the-root-issue&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: no-painkiller-approach-we-tackle-the-root-issue&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;‚ÄúNo painkiller‚Äù approach. We tackle the root issue&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a specific piece of software or hardware is not delivering the required performance or reliability, we should analyze the core design&#x2F;algorithm and its usage of soft&#x2F;hard components to determine the root causes of persistent issues to be solved.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Currently, most storage vendors follow the path of least resistance when trying to improve on performance. Their solution for meeting performance targets is to use faster components (CPU, memory, network card, proprietary acceleration) rather than looking at the core algorithms that drive the utilization of those components. Swapping components for faster ones perpetuates a cycle of cutting corners and focuses reliance on innovation from hardware component providers rather than solving the more fundamental and underlying issues. That‚Äôs a ‚Äúpainkiller‚Äù approach.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Zero-OS was designed to solve root problem issues by design. While still using high-performance hardware components on the ThreeFold Grid, the algorithm of Zero-OS maximizes utilization possibilities. This enables greater performance and sustainability. Some key examples how this is achieved:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;eliminating-unnecessary-elements-from-standard-architectures&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#eliminating-unnecessary-elements-from-standard-architectures&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: eliminating-unnecessary-elements-from-standard-architectures&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Eliminating unnecessary elements from standard architectures&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtualization adds a layer of software between the actual end-user workload and physical hardware. It also allows for multiple workloads to run on the same hardware by using excess capacity. There is definitely merit in building a virtualization solution. Building an effective virtualization solution that does not require abundant context switching is key and this is why Zero-OS has been developed. Zero-OS uses a minimal Linux kernel that allows for a number of user spaces to co-exist. In these user spaces, containerized versions of software can be run, eliminating the need for hypervisors, virtual OS to fuel the virtual machines, and guest operating systems. This also minimizes the required overhead for the host OS.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimizing-network-connections-usage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#minimizing-network-connections-usage&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: minimizing-network-connections-usage&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Minimizing network connections usage&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supercomputing delivered many new technologies. But, not all of them are usable solutions for everyday workloads. One technology invented to make supercomputers performant is the use of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA). RDMA allowed physical CPU boards (containing both CPUs and memory) to access other CPU boards in memory stored data over a dedicated channel. This eliminated the need to transport data between CPU nodes over network connections (or other mainstream means to exchange data). The result was a considerable reduction in overhead created when allowing distributed end user workloads to operate over multiple physical cores. The leading server and storage solutions brands have never considered nor implemented such mechanisms. This resulted in an increased need for faster networks - increasing complexity, costs, efforts and resources needed to operate solutions.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
RDMA is only used in certified farms and requires involvement of TFTech.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimizing-disk-usage&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#minimizing-disk-usage&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: minimizing-disk-usage&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Minimizing disk usage&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The storage solution uses slow and big (the bigger the better) HDD disks which drive in rack density. As they spin slower they consume less power and need less cooling. But then, how can you deal with read&#x2F;write intensive workloads? The storage algorithm uses a SSD cache to acknowledge Inputs&#x2F;Outputs coming from the applications, fills the erasure coded data blocks in large (up to 64MB) storage containers and writes the big chunks of data on the big and slow HHDs. If you are familiar with HDD disks, you know they like to be streamed on instead of having a lot of small bits written in a scratchy way.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Continuous innovation in all of these areas are leading to an efficient technology stack.&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#introduction&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: introduction&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Introduction&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-cost-of-complexity-in-traditional-it&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-cost-of-complexity-in-traditional-it&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-cost-of-complexity-in-traditional-it&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The ‚Äúcost‚Äù of complexity in traditional IT&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classic IT infrastructure setup is complex and is not cost-effective. Applications need a specific environment to operate in, built by integrating different technology components from different vendors. Elements of such a setup are operating systems, storage systems, networks, security systems, authentication systems, and more.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Putting components together is called (system) integration, and integration requires agreement on how these components will fit together and the knowledge to do it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This complexity and need for integration originate from the way the IT industry historically developed. With time more and more layers appeared to bring new possibilities. Additional layers masked existing problems. Instead of fixing the underlying issues, several third parties needed to be involved, adding complexity and increased costs (such as license costs, upgrades, updates, etc.). Complexity has become a business model.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: where-can-we-get-inspiration-to-do-it-a-different-way&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Where can we get inspiration to do it a different way?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we could build IT architectures in a different way.  What if we would not accept component solution approaches anymore and start over with a completely blank sheet of paper?  Would we then come up with a different way of actually building automation, architectures, and business models?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-at-nature-for-inspiration&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#looking-at-nature-for-inspiration&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: looking-at-nature-for-inspiration&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Looking at nature for inspiration&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs start by looking for inspiration in nature. Suppose we consider IT systems to be a complex system. Are there parallels that we can draw between systems that exist in nature (and have evolved and improved over thousands of years) and those within the IT industry?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In nature, we see two kinds of systems (societies): centralized and decentralized systems.  Examples of centralized systems are herds, groups, or schools of animals living together where there is a hierarchy in the way they organize themselves. For decentralized systems, we can look at beehives and anthills.  Organizing efforts and benefits are distinct and come at a different cost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;centralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#centralized-systems-in-nature&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: centralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Centralized systems in nature&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In centralized systems, there is governance of activities, wealth positions, and so forth.  Think of a group of lions or chimpanzees.  There is always an alpha male who is dominant in the whole group.  He is the only that enjoys all of the benefits because the entire group&#x2F;structure works towards his wishes.  He gets to mate with most female group members because the system believes that he has the strongest genes to help the group to survive in the future. The dominant male also gets most of the food gathered by the group, and if he doesn‚Äôt get it, he will claim it by showing his dominance and fight for it.  All the others are working towards this alpha male, and all the other males in the group will occasionally challenge the alpha male for dominance.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This is very similar to how the IT industry has been operating to date:  there are a few alpha males in the industry - one for each sector that can be recognized (for example, in the Cloud Industry, you have Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and on the system integration front you have Dell, Siemens, CA Technologies).  They end up with the majority of businesses available in their specific markets. When challenged by new companies, they fight them (in every way possible, including killing them or acquiring them). And in analogy to the animal group, these alpha male companies have a lot of organizations that work with them, usually called ‚Äúpartners‚Äù or ‚Äúchannels.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;decentralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralized-systems-in-nature&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralized-systems-in-nature&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralized systems in nature&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decentralized systems on &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decentralised_system&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, we learn; ‚ÄúOne of the most well-known examples of a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù decentralized system is one used by insect colonies such as Ants. In these insect colonies, control is distributed among the biological agents who act upon local information and local interactions to create complex and universal behavior collectively. While individually exhibiting simple behaviors, these agents achieve universal goals such as feeding the colony or raising the brood using dynamical mechanisms like non-explicit communication and exploiting their closely coupled action and perception systems. Without any form of central authority, these insect colonies achieve their universal goals by performing required tasks and by responding to changing conditions in their external environment. They also adjust the number of workers performing each task to ensure the completion of all tasks. For example, ant colonies guide their global behavior (in terms of foraging, patrolling, brood care, and nest maintenance) using a pulsing, shifting web of Spatio-temporal patterned interactions that rely on antennal contact rate and olfactory sensing. While these interactions consist of both interactions with the environment and each other, ants do not direct the behavior of other ants. They thus never have a ‚Äúcentral controller‚Äù dictating what is to be done to achieve global goals.‚Äú
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
So nature has provided us with solid examples of centralized and decentralized systems.  For much of what works in the modern world, we have ended up using the centralized model governing enterprises and countries.  Various industries have also adopted the centralized model where there is a pyramid structure, and everything works towards the alpha males.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-different-approach-to-creating-and-operating-it-workloads&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A different approach to creating and operating IT workloads&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if we can develop a new concept for creating, deploying, and operating IT workloads.  What if we say goodbye to the centralized way of controlling IT workloads.  Can we develop an idea that works in a decentralized way?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-concept&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-concept&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-concept&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The concept&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build this concept, we will draw the use of the human way of operating a large ship. The crew of a vessel has different roles, which we will call the &lt;em&gt;coordinators&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. Some of these coordinators could be a captain, officers, engineers, and oilers.  These coordinators have in-depth knowledge of their specific tasks but usually lack a detailed understanding of the other roles. In the ‚Äúhive‚Äù of a ship, the specific requests to get tasks done are sent to coordinators who will receive, interpret, execute their particular tasks, and report the (non-) progress of these tasks or subtasks.  For example, the captain will create and agree to a schedule of maintenance tasks for the engine room. These are daily, weekly and monthly tasks that should be completed by the engineers and oilers. The engineers and oilers do not get continuous input from the captain. They get one instruction to follow the schedule and know what needs to be done for every task. The intermediate state (what is complete and what still needs to be addressed) is stored by the coordinators executing the tasks. This is the most efficient way of accomplishing tasks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;jumping-to-the-it-industry&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#jumping-to-the-it-industry&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: jumping-to-the-it-industry&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Jumping to the IT industry&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we bring this concept to the IT world, we conclude that today‚Äôs IT systems are built in a significantly different way.  Most architectures (if not all) have a central facility that stores &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; information and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; states of activity in a so-called central ‚Äòdatabase.‚Äô A general norm within IT. However, these types of architectures are inefficient and are very complex - like the ship analogy -  a central command room (database) is created where every coordinator needs to report back. (1) The current level of activity, (2) the completion (state) of tasks, (3) the proper understanding of upcoming tasks by the coordinator to accomplish tasks in-progress or future - hence leading to the undesirable outcome of complexity due to centralization. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In the ship example, we deem this type of functioning&#x2F;workflow inefficient; however, in the IT world, it is a common way of doing it.  Furthermore, IT infrastructures usually have different databases to store ‚Äústate‚Äù in different parts of the IT architecture.  The analogy would translate to different command rooms that orchestrate different functions on the ship in our ship. This, in turn, introduces the need for another role in starting coordinating between the different command rooms to ensure that all information is shared and communicated. Taking this pattern forward leads to an endless loop of adding interfaces, layers, bridges between different parts of the system that all store information, multiple times, and in different ways.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By design, a decentralized IT  architecture should not use centralized data storage (databases) for multiple tasks (roles). It instead should feature a similar approach to the way of functioning as in the ‚Äòship‚Äô example. In this architecture,  roles get short and precise instructions of the jobs to be completed and autonomously execute.  We call these execution engines &lt;em&gt;coordinators&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.  Coordinators receive instructions, run on instructions and store all information about the current task &lt;em&gt;locally.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;  They store all the relevant information in a local storage facility (available to the individual coordinators only) and provide information about the state of execution if and when other coordinators ask for a state update.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify common IT architectures, we should look at a   new way of creating such a system that takes the current standards into account:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No people involved in integrating different components into a single solution&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which, as a consequence, means no revenue generation based on creating and managing complexity.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No central state &#x2F; operational data storage&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual automated actors with specific knowledge for specific tasks&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent operating actors completing specific tasks
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Such a system should ideally be owned by many (not just a single organization, bringing centralization back into the equations) that operate IT tasks for many.  We have not seen such a system in existence, but we are as TFTech building and rolling out technology that can do this.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
We believe that IT‚Äôs future is in decentralization where specific coordinators (bots) will roam a network of capacity looking for a task to do, making themselves available where needed, creating more of them when the system grows, and allowing the global population to deploy and operate IT workloads.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone thinks that Satoshi Nakamoto invented blockchain technology when he published his whitepaper in January 2009 to make a digital currency the first use case. But it was not!.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In 1991, Dr. W. Scott Stornetta published a white paper in which he introduced a ‚Äòblockchain‚Äô as a decentralized database where digital transactions are secured. The research focused on creating a digital hierarchy system that time-stamped and chronologically secured deals in a chain of blocks.  The first considered use case for blockchain technology was to sign and store land deeds digitally. The technology‚Äôs main characteristics were decentralization and immutability across the process of storing transaction data.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Satoshi was the person (or part of a group of people) that used these blockchain principles to create the first digital currency - Bitcoin.  The rest is history, from one to many digital currencies based on different creation principles (also referred to as cryptocurrencies, digital coins, etc.) that have been launched and existed for over a decade and have begun to come more into the mainstream purview.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;decentralization-and-immutability&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#decentralization-and-immutability&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: decentralization-and-immutability&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Decentralization and immutability&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two characteristics that have spawned interest in Blockchain technology are decentralization and immutability. In the current world, centralization is everywhere, in most industries, governments, education systems, the world wide web (Internet), and more. All roads these days seem to lead to centralized setups.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Examples of centralized setups today:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monetary&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Fiat currencies are governed and controlled by central banks.  According to Wikipedia: ‚ÄúA central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages a state‚Äôs currency, money supply, and interest rates. Central banks also oversee the commercial banking system of their respective countries. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank has a monopoly on increasing the monetary base in the state and prints the national currency, which serves as the state‚Äôs legal tender. Central banks also act as a ‚Äúlender of last resort‚Äù to the banking sector during a financial crisis. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the solvency of member institutions, prevent bank runs, and prevent reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.‚Äú So central banks control fiat currencies, and other institutions control central banks.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Wide Web (WWW)&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: The World Wide Web is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and accessible via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. Although distributed by design, this technology shares and exposes globally developed information and centralized functions crucial to make this World Wide Web work: large (commercial) monopolies have developed centralized search facilities, e.g., yellow pages of the world wide web. These search facilities now control what you find when you are looking for a specific search term.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
There seems to be a natural ‚Äúdesire‚Äù to organize and create different things with central control. Probably the result of our (humankind) social models based on hierarchies and competition. These social models have influenced a lot of what we have built in the industrial and information revolution - creating centralization as the defacto standard of building anything.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Now that we have invented a technology that potentially can build different things without a lot of centralization, we need to be careful to use it for the right things.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-myths&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-myths&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-myths&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain myths&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate what potential right use cases exist for blockchain technologies, let spend some time on some of the blockchain myths created in recent years. Similar to other new technologies, blockchains market themselves as a miracle technology that overcomes many (if not any) of the challenges and difficulties that exist in modern-day digital technology. Let‚Äôs name and investigate a few.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-are-super-scalable&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains are ‚ÄúSuper Scalable‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are they? Pure blockchain deployments are not super scalable compared to conventional (server-based) transaction methods.  Current financial blockchain transaction times are very slow compared to any other (currency) transaction technologies out there, being it card transactions like Mastercard, VISA, or money transfers from one bank account to another.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-technology-brings-impeccable-security&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain technology brings ‚ÄúImpeccable security.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very questionable! While blockchains use cryptographic standards, the methods to ensure privacy is entirely outside of any blockchain standards and implementations. It‚Äôs every implementer‚Äôs responsibility to ensure security, therefore mostly handled as it is in the old (conventional?) world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: when-using-blockchains-trustworthiness-is-guaranteed&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;When using Blockchains, ‚ÄúTrustworthiness is guaranteed.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By what? Blockchain ensures the integrity of transactions and information storage, but otherwise, nothing is inherently trustworthy about any fact stored on the Blockchain. You need to corroborate trustworthiness by ensuring that the parties who store information in the Blockchain are incorruptible and that these facts are correct ‚Äîjust as you would in the rest of the world without using blockchain technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-can-manage-anything&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains can manage ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a protocol expressed in code, and this does not define in terms of any standard. There are no standards bodies to provide sanctioned implementation rules or guidance.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Many contracts or types of data are better dealt with not on a blockchain: as it is a database that has only write and read functionality, but no update nor deletion is possible, it‚Äôs even dangerous to post sensitive and personal data on a blockchain, and if not used well, there might raise conflicts with regulations such as GDPR. However, a blockchain can provide consensus where required.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: smart-contracts-on-the-blockchain-can-do-everything&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Smart contracts on the Blockchain can do ‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially but maybe not in the way how people see it today. While this is technically true, Blockchain is limited to well-understood and straightforward use cases, without ambiguities. Smart contracts are essentially rocket science. By design, once published (launched), you cannot revise or bug fix them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchain-deployments-if-not-public-go-private&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-deployments-if-not-public-go-private&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-deployments-if-not-public-go-private&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain deployments ‚ÄúIf not public - go private!‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the same thing! Private blockchains are not the answer to privacy or restricted access to information. Purely private&#x2F;enterprise blockchains might fail to realize any of the benefits of Blockchain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-new-feature-justifies-deploying-a-new-blockchain&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A new feature, ‚Äújustifies deploying a new Blockchain.‚Äù&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community-driven blockchain products are being forked left and right by private players who enhance them in various ways. But only the open-source blockchains with the largest communities and install-plus-adoption bases will persist. The rest are mainly lab experiments, and 99.9 percent of these probably fail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockchain-myths-undone&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchain-myths-undone&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchain-myths-undone&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchain myths undone&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Blockchain is a hyped new technology, but they are not the answer to everything.  Just like with any other technology or tool, you need to consider if the use case considered carefully is appropriate. In the end, it is only neutral characteristics that might be a reason for applying a blockchain or not:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a need for decentralization?&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a need for immutability?
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
When considering Blockchain technology for a specific purpose, proper due diligence should happen. This to determine the fit and implementing it if it enhances value for the organization. Humans play a vital role in the decision process and are required to find solutions for the flaws that blockchains bring along.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Scalability, security, trustworthiness, functionality are to be added by humans to blockchain deployments.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
This delicate mix of characteristics to be implemented explains why many Blockchain projects don‚Äôt succeed, despite the rightful claims around the disruptive nature of the technology.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Two frequent mistakes within the Industry:&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technology is used as the ultimate technology to solve all the problems described above, and this often leads to failure in the end as Blockchain can‚Äôt fulfill these promises.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The technology is used under the false pretext that decentralization is wanted, whereas the real intention is to be in control. Blockchain thinking also requires an entirely different way of thinking than the classical models embedded in the heart of our economies: concentration of power &amp;amp; control and competition need to make room for decentralization and collaboration.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: blockchains-are-here-to-stay&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Blockchains are here to stay!&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the hype around blockchain technology and also all the failed initiatives, blockchain technology does allow for digital worlds to exist without centralization.  The information revolution has brought forward a lot of progress and innovation to the people; however, the outcome has also been only a few large organizations controlling all of it.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Examples are:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online search: Google&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online social: Facebook, Twitter&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online banking: any large international bank&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online insurance:  few insurance alliances&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer Relationship Management: SalesForce&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise Resource Management: Oracle, SAP
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
All these organizations are leading in their specific digital innovation sector, and some of them even provide services for free.  Nothing is for free in this world and reality -in return for these services, you accept the terms and conditions which allow the companies to use your personal information and user statistics for their benefits and make money from this behavior derived data. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Most industry leaders have become so powerful that there is almost no way around them anymore. You are practically obliged to comply with their terms and conditions to do something useful with the Internet today.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
The world is awakening and seeking alternatives in which such monopolistic structures do not control data and information.  Blockchain technologies allow new solutions to be built without central governing bodies, creating person-to-person sharing and trading opportunities.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-combination-of-people-and-blockchains-is-really-powerful&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;The combination of people and blockchains is really powerful&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People remain the best to create decentralized business models that combine Blockchain‚Äôs strengths with complementary measures to compensate for the weaknesses of the technology. Blockchains are not replacing people. Blockchain technology is just a tool that enhances people‚Äôs ability to organize themselves around decentralized initiatives that require no central body to govern and control. Therefore, Blockchain is a powerful tool indeed but remains just a tool.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: a-platform-for-people-to-start-blockchains&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;A platform for people to start blockchains&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there would be a platform where the strong points of blockchains (decentralization) could enable people to organize themselves around a random initiative and launch it based on blockchain technology?  Blockchain As a Service (BAAS).
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
A platform like that could be powerful to enable people around the world to use and benefit from blockchain technology to organize themselves around digital initiatives, currencies, finance, trade, company, anything. Let‚Äôs consider a small example:
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
e.g., Sixty people want to start an organization in which they all have an equal stake.  They can organize this by going to the notary and establishing a company with equity and dividing the equity amongst them. They can run quarterly &#x2F;annual meetings to govern and control the company. They would also need an administration to record decisions and communicate across the organization.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
What if a platform could launch several blockchain nodes (60, one for each of them) and record all decisions, having all information trackable and traceable for anyone? Blockchain As A Service (BAAS) will enable people to organize themselves independently and create new movements, companies, groups, tribes. This would be a powerful platform allowing many people (and hopefully all people) to organize themselves in new ways, free of the need to have notaries, lawyers, and contracts.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
However, to build such a platform, compliance is needed with some pretty specific requirements.  Requirements that enable such a platform not to be governed and controlled by a single organization.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The requirements for such a platform would sum up as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single organization cannot own the platform, it needs to be owned by many&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Such a platform cannot have administrator access.  Administrators access takes away the neutrality and privacy that such a platform requires.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be very efficient.  To be available to all people globally, it needs to be affordable for anyone.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The platform needs to be everywhere.  Part of the efficiency is that it should require expensive international access lines - it needs to be able to live everywhere - in well connected (and affordable) areas as well as in less well-connected places.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
Such a platform is a very different platform than most of what we know today.  It needs to be a platform build by many people, for anyone.  It needs not be governed by a single organization; it needs to be governed by many.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt; 
People with the right intentions need to collectively build a platform based on hardware owned by many and software that is open and can be inspected and improved by anyone. It is a platform created by people for people using blockchain technology to achieve a genuinely decentralized nature of the platform running Blockchain as a service.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
People should always remain as the element that brings trust in IT. Blockchains help to register that trust forever.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: threefold-s-technology-does-not-follow-the-traditional-it-model&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs technology does not follow the traditional IT model&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Edge internet needs a different approach. So, we started from scratch and shaped a new approach. ThreeFold‚Äôs open-source technology addresses the scalability, security, storage, energy, and operating issues by simplifying architectures and not relying on third-party software. This drives down costs and improves efficiencies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-is-threefold-s-technology-toolbox&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;What is ThreeFold‚Äôs Technology Toolbox?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold‚Äôs technology is based on three primary building blocks:  Stateless Computing, Self-Healing Technology, and Blockchain technology - this is the core of our ‚ÄúTechnology Toolbox‚Äú.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stateless Computing&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: a stateless operating system, Zero-OS, enabling distributed hardware to form an Edge Internet grid generating IT storage and compute capacity&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Healing Technology&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: controls and operates a distributed cloud and reserves, procures, and executes workloads on the grid using our Jumpscale platform. It delivers autoscaling and automation frameworks that enable self-healing and can be adapted for any kind of IT workload.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blockchain Technology&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Via Rivine - our secure, scalable ‚Äúproof of stake‚Äù blockchain, along with our identity management platform, ItsYou.online. Our blockchain technology enables user authentication, access controls, secure workloads, and heightened security.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enabling-stateless-computing&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#enabling-stateless-computing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: enabling-stateless-computing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Enabling Stateless Computing&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global decentralized internet will be composed of thousands (millions?) of nodes distributed geographically.  This means the decentralized internet must be powered by a stateless operating system that can be booted via the Internet (as opposed to living on the node locally). This removes the complexity of upgrades, truck rolls, etc. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The engineers developed new blockchain algorithms based on proof of stake for validation purposes and turned this into our Rivine open-source blockchain software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Unlike the ‚Äúproof of work‚Äù blockchains that currently dominate the space, our Rivine blockchain is scalable, green, and secure - and does not rely on huge mining resources.  We run our blockchain on approximately 200 dedicated nodes and do not rely on any third-party software.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition to our blockchain technology, we have also developed ItsYou.Online, an identity, and access management platform.  Itsyou. online uses three-factor authentication to manage access on our network and facilitate execution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
