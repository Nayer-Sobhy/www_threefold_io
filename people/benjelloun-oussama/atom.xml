		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Privacy and decentralization are some of the values shared by both &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.presearch.io&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Presearch&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;threefold.io&quot;&gt;ThreeFold&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, at the core of their missions to create scalable technologies that can positively impact the lives of millions of individuals and enterprises around the globe.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch and ThreeFold are thrilled to officially announce their collaborative partnership. Presearch is &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearch.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;a community-powered, decentralized search engine&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; that provides better results while protecting your privacy and rewarding you when you search. And ThreeFold is the world‚Äôs largest peer-to-peer cloud, bringing privacy and security, cost-efficiencies, ease-of-use, and true IT decentralization to the market.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch (and its node and storage infrastructure) will benefit from ThreeFold‚Äôs peer-to-peer cloud in two different ways:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 1-powering-presearch-node-operators-with-a-decentralized-cloud-infrastructure&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;1. Powering Presearch node operators with a decentralized cloud infrastructure&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Presearch community will be able to deploy their Presearch nodes in a few clicks in a completely decentralized cloud infrastructure, using the ThreeFold peer-to-peer cloud and its developer tools. Thus, they can escape the monopolies of centralized cloud providers, and reduce the technical complexity of running Blockchain nodes. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Colin Pape, Presearch‚Äôs CEO, said in a statement, ‚ÄúWe are excited to partner with the ThreeFold team to offer our community members an easy way to quickly deploy Presearch Nodes on ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid, the world‚Äôs largest server network powered by blockchain technology.‚Äù
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch has recently opened its beta testing program for node operators looking to become part of the revolutionary network that is changing the way individuals around the world can search the web ‚Äì in a significantly more private, inclusive, and rewarding environment. Anyone who believes in the decentralization of search engines should &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;presearchcommunity.typeform.com&#x2F;to&#x2F;UkDumktm&quot;&gt;sign up to their beta testers list&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and get in touch with Presearch to be one of the early adopters. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: 2-leveraging-threefold-s-decentralized-storage-to-store-the-future-of-the-search-engine-experience&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;2. Leveraging ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized storage to store the future of the search engine experience&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presearch and ThreeFold are exploring the usage of ThreeFold‚Äôs decentralized storage capacity to store and archive Presearch‚Äôs indexes and other data running the search engine. The main goal is to provide an unbreakable data storage and backup infrastructure for the future of the search engine experience that the top-notch team behind Presearch is building.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In addition, ThreeFold looks forward to advocating for Presearch and integrating the decentralized search engine into its current and future solutions for a more private and inclusive internet experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: powering-the-threefold-community-s-search-engine-experience-with-presearch&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;Powering the ThreeFold community‚Äôs search engine experience with Presearch&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThreeFold will be establishing Presearch‚Äôs decentralized search engine as its main search engine partner, advocating for its usage within its growing community of developers, cloud capacity farmers, enterprises, and users. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
As stated by Weynand Kuijpers, ‚ÄúPresearch is creating a search engine by people for people. The internet has moved from data sharing to centralized data harvesting. Presearch is undoing that by creating user control over data stored, presenting a (digital) return for contributing to the system and improving search results, and making it decentralized. ThreeFold is looking forward to co-creating a decentralized mechanism where the search engine is broken down and operates everywhere, and users are in control of their own identity and data.‚Äú
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
More to come as the partnership develops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-presearch&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#about-presearch&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: about-presearch&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;About Presearch:&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are tired of Big Tech companies dominating the internet, censoring content and controlling the social narrative by manipulating information to fit an agenda. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Presearch provides improved access to information and increased search choice with its community-driven search engine that leverages blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to empower and reward users. More than 1.6 million people have already joined the service.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
In 2020, Presearch launched its innovative keyword staking sponsorship platform that enables promoters to lock their Presearch PRE cryptocurrency tokens against different keywords in order to have their promotional ads displayed. More than 60 million PRE tokens have already been locked.
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Now Presearch is launching a decentralized search engine that rewards node operators with PRE tokens when they run Presearch nodes. Through its partnership with ThreeFold, anyone will be able to easily launch a Presearch node running on the ThreeFold decentralized peer-to-peer internet grid with no technical knowledge required.

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today, ThreeFold and WaykiChain are pleased to officially announce their collaborative partnership. Both ThreeFold and WaykiChain found clear alignment on decentralizing the internet for people and businesses and share the same core values that encompass their respective visions. 
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
Through this collaboration, the WaykiChain developer community will be enabled to deploy and maintain their nodes and any of their IT Workloads using the &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.threefold.io&quot;&gt;Threefold P2P Cloud&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. This will empower them to decentralize their cloud-computing infrastructures, with far more affordability, and distribution compared to centralized cloud-providers,  and with native cloud automation via ThreeFold‚Äôs &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;library.threefold.me&#x2F;info&#x2F;sdk&#x2F;#&#x2F;smart_contract&quot;&gt;Smart contract for IT&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
&lt;br&#x2F;&gt;
The ThreeFold team invites blockchain enthusiasts, developers, and anyone interested in being part of WaykiChain community to deploy a mainnet node, or to explore building a Dapp on top of WayKiChain.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
