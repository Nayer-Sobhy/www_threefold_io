### **The Missing Layer for IT**

ThreeFold is a decentralized IT infrastructure delivering low-level compute, storage, and network constructs that empower individuals, organizations, and communities to build their own sets of use cases.

### **Under the hood**

Take a look at some of the key innovations which make ThreeFold come alive.

#### Zero OS

<br>

A minimalistic, more efficient server operating system retaining the Linux kernel but fundamentally redesigned for heightened security, efficiency, and support for true peer-to-peer and decentralized workloads.

|||

#### Smart Contract for IT

<br>

Secure, verified, multi-signed authentication enabling the autonomous reservation of capacity, storing files, deployment of applications, and more, in just a few clicks.

|||

#### Mycelium

<br>

A new overlay network layer designed to enhance the existing Internet infrastructure while remaining compatible with all current applications, empowering true peer-to-peer communication.

#### FList

<br>

An image format that separates image data (comprising files, subfile parts) from the metadata describing the image structure, offering a versatile approach for handling various build and delivery scenarios.

|||

#### Zero-Stor

<br>

A scalable quantum safe backend storage system designed where data can never be lost nor corrupted – secure, private, and fast enough for most use cases, and designed for a decentralized context.

|||

#### Quantum Safe File System

<br>

A FUSE-based filesystem utilizing Zero-Stor as its backend. Metadata is safeguarded to prevent loss, inheriting Zero-Stor's benefits and simplifying usage for developers and system administrators.

### The ThreeFold Grid

### **Connected globally and commercially ready**

#### **Mainnet: 3.12** | Testnet: 3.12 | Devnet 3.13

<br>

The ThreeFold Grid is already globally connected by a community of individuals and organizations hosting local Internet capacity.<br>Today the technology is in its third generation.
