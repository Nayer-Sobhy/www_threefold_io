            <p>ThreeFold is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, open-source Internet platform, allowing people to provide and utilize Internet capacity directly – without intermediaries.
            <br>
            A sovereign alternative to the centralized Internet.</p>

## Why Do We Need an Alternative?

### **Overcoming Internet Inequalities**

{% end %}

{% row(style="center reverse mbottom narrow") %}

The current Internet is **outdated**. It is built on a centralized antiquated foundation, which hinders scalability and efficiency.

<br>

The current Internet is **not scalable**. Over 3 billion people lack reliable Internet access.

<br>

The current Internet is **not sustainable**. It consumes between 5-10% of the world’s energy.

### **Over a decade ago, a group of early Internet pioneers, <br>who understood the problems of the centralized Internet model first-hand, <br>came together to re-imagine the infrastructure for an open and decentralized Internet.**

### **But we didn't just imagine it – we built it. Join us in evolving the Internet, together.**

### **The ThreeFold Grid v3.9**

## **Live and Operational**

<!-- section 5 -->

{% row(style="center margin narrow") %}

### **The ThreeFold Grid is community-owned and managed. The stack was built around principles of open-source and simplicity, and to be compatibile with current and future IT standards – from Kubernetes to Docker to IPFS and S3. It is an alternative to the centralized Internet model – a decentralized infrastructure for the builders of tomorrow.**

## Take Action Today

### **And Create Tomorrow**

## Support the Project

We're open-source and decentralized, so we use a token called $TFT to fuel the movement, which is the medium of exchange<br>on the ThreeFold Grid. Buy $TFT to use grid services or for future utilization.
