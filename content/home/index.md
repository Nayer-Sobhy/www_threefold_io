## Decentralized Autonomous<br>Internet Infrastructure

ThreeFold is a globally-distributed grid of storage, compute, and network capacity, acting as “no middleman” Internet resources between independent capacity providers and users. Founded by Internet 1.0 Pioneers and supported by a global community.

## The **Layer Zero** for a New Digital Era

ThreeFold is an end-to-end autonomous cloud platform designed to deliver ultra secure, scalable, green, deterministic IT workload deployments close to the edge. Our unique technology provides unparalleled  sovereignty, scalability and efficiency features that emerging IT workloads require, and that traditional cloud infrastructures cannot deliver.

## Together **We Build.** Start **Your Journey.**

The future is about participation and working together to achieve our goals. As a decentralized movement, we encourage the community to get involved. This new Internet can only succeed if we find ways to collaborate where we together pull this Internet concept forward. Below, please find some of the ways you can join us in building a better Internet.

### **Farm** Local Internet Capacity

By connecting hardware at your home or office – or anywhere you'd like – you provide Internet capacity <br> for the people around you and earn a digital currency called TFT.

<br>

*About TFT, we utilize a token as a mechanism for creating and using IT (Internet) capacity, which is essential for enabling our digital lives. For us the token is not an individual product, rather a way to exchange value within the ThreeFold ecosystem.*
