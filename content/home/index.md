## Why Do We Need an Alternative?

### **Overcoming Internet Inequalities**

{% end %}

{% row(style="center reverse mbottom narrow") %}

The current Internet is **outdated**. It is built on a centralized antiquated foundation, which hinders scalability and efficiency.

<br>

The current Internet is **not scalable**. Over 3 billion people lack reliable Internet access.

<br>

The current Internet is **not sustainable**. It consumes between 5-10% of the world’s energy.

<br>

Your digital life depends on hyperscale data centers controlled by a handful of tech giants. The majority of web 2 and even web 3 services are built on these foundations.

## Internet Re-Imagined. Internet Re-Built.

### **Over a decade ago, a group of early Internet pioneers, <br>who understood the problems of the centralized Internet model first-hand, <br>came together to re-imagine the infrastructure for an open and decentralized Internet.**

### **But we didn't just imagine it – we built it. Join us in evolving the Internet, together.**

### **Beyond a Protocol**

The ThreeFold Grid is not just another protocol, it's a community-owned and managed low level decentralized Internet capacity layer and infrastructure, on top of which any protocol can run.

### **Complementing Web3**

ThreeFold is not a Web3 project, but we love Web3 and the ThreeFold Grid can host and complement any Web3 project, finally providing a truly decentralized backbone for the space.

<br>

### **Highly-Compatible**

The stack was built around open-source and simplicity, and to be compatibile with current and future IT standards such as Kubernetes, Docker, IPFS and S3. If it runs on Linux, it can be hosted on ThreeFold.

<!-- It is an alternative to the centralized Internet model – a decentralized infrastructure for the builders of tomorrow.** -->

## Support the Project

We're open-source and decentralized, so we use a token called $TFT to fuel the movement, which is the medium of exchange<br>on the ThreeFold Grid. Buy $TFT to use grid services or for future utilization.
