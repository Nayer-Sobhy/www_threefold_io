### ThreeFold is a decentralized, peer-to-peer, open-source Internet platform, allowing people to provide and utilize Internet capacity directly – without intermediaries.

### A sovereign alternative to the centralized Internet.

## Why Do We Need an Alternative?

### Overcoming Internet Inequalities

{% end %}

{% row(style="center narrow") %}

### **Outdated.**

The current Internet is built on a centralized antiquated foundation, hindering scalability and efficiency.

### **Not equal.**

Over 3 billion people lack reliable Internet access.

### **Not sustainable.**

The current Internet consumes between 5-10% of the world’s energy.

## Evolving the Internet, Together

### Over a decade ago, a group of early Internet pioneers, who understood the problems of the centralized Internet model first-hand, came together to re-imagine the infrastructure for an open and decentralized Internet.

### But we didn't just imagine it – we built it.

### The ThreeFold Grid v3.9.0

## **Live and Operational**

{% end %}

{% row(style="center mbottom narrow") %}

### The ThreeFold Grid is community-owned and managed. The stack was built around principles of open-source and simplicity, and to be compatibile with current and future IT standards – from Kubernetes to Docker to IPFS and S3. It is an alternative to the centralized Internet model – a decentralized infrastructure for the builders of tomorrow.

## Support the Project

We're open-source and decentralized, so we use a token called $TFT to fuel the movement, which is the medium of exchange<br>on the ThreeFold Grid. Buy $TFT to use grid services or for future utilization.
