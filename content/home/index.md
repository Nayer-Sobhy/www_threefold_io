## Why ThreeFold

ThreeFold’s unique infrastructure can operate without centralized authority or server, empowering people and communities to build and store applications on a decentralized network owned and operated by its participants.  ThreeFold is open-source, nobody owns or controls the ThreeFold Grid and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, ThreeFold fosters the security, trust and freedom that are often missing in today’s internet.
