### ThreeFold is a decentralized, open-source, peer-to-peer Internet platform that allows people to directly buy and sell Internet capacity – without any intermediaries. An alternative to the centralized data center model.

## Today's Internet is ...

{% end %}

{% row(style="center narrow") %}

### **Outdated.**

The current Internet is built on a centralized antiquated foundation, hindering scalability and efficiency.

### **Not equal.**

Over 3 billion people lack reliable Internet access.

### **Not sustainable.**

The current Internet consumes between 5-10% of the world’s energy.

## We Are Evolving the Internet, Together

Over a decade ago, a group of **early Internet pioneers**, who understood the problems of the centralized Internet model first-hand, came together to **re-imagine** the infrastructure for an **open and decentralized Internet**.

<br>

**But we didn't just imagine it – we built it.**

## So Much Built So Far

The ThreeFold Grid is community-owned and managed. The stack was built around principles of open-source and simplicity, and to be compatibile with current and future IT standards – from Kubernetes to Docker to IPFS and S3. It is an alternative to the centralized Internet model – a decentralized infrastructure for the builders of tomorrow.

## A Resilient Foundation

ThreeFold’s unique infrastructure can operate without centralized authority or server, empowering people and communities to build and store applications on a decentralized network owned and operated by its participants.  
<br>
ThreeFold is open-source, nobody owns or controls the ThreeFold Grid and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, ThreeFold fosters the security, trust and freedom that are often missing in today’s internet.

## Support the Project

We're open-source and decentralized, so we use a token called $TFT to fuel the movement, which is the medium of exchange<br>on the ThreeFold Grid. Buy $TFT to use grid services or for future utilization.
