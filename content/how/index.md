### **Internet re-imagined, Internet re-built**

ThreeFold is an autonomous edge infrastructure delivering storage, compute, and network capacity,<br>acting as “no middleman” Internet resources between independent capacity providers and users.

### **It all starts with a new operating system**

To revolutionize the Internet, we had to rethink how we host our applications.<br>Zero OS is an innovative stateless operating system based on the Linux kernel, redesigned for<br>heightened security, efficiency, and support for true peer-to-peer and decentralized workloads.

### **A computer becomes a 3Node**

Once booted onto a modern computer with adequate specifications, the computer is essentially locked to only expose raw compute, storage, and network capacity in a seamless and efficient manner.

### **Resource provisioning & utilization**

Now that these Internet resources have been exposed, they are ready to be utilized. First, we gather the necessary deployment information, specifying the workloads we want to deploy. Then, we create a contract on the blockchain. Once the contract is in place, the 3Node diligently reports its resource consumption to the blockchain at regular intervals.
