The Internet is complex and multi-layered, touching virtually every aspect of our modern lives. At its core, it comprises three essential layers: compute & storage, network, and application. Understanding these components is key to grasping how digital information is processed, stored, and accessed across the globe.

This blog post will explore these foundational aspects of the Internet and share insights into ThreeFold's journey in reshaping the global Cloud & Internet infrastructure.

### **The Three Layers of the Internet**

Understanding the three fundamental layers of the Internet’s architecture is crucial to grasping how digital services are delivered to end-users around the globe. Let's break down these components:

#### **Compute & Storage**

Compute is the powerhouse of the Internet, providing the necessary processing power to run the various software applications and services that populate the Internet. This involves everything from simple web hosting to complex computational tasks like data analysis and artificial intelligence. In essence, it's the brain behind the operations, turning code into action. Compute resources are provided by servers located in data centers, cloud platforms, and increasingly, decentralized networks.

Storage acts as the Internet's memory, a space where data is securely kept for future access. This includes everything from your personal photos and documents to the databases that store website content and user information. Efficient and reliable storage solutions are vital for keeping the Internet's vast amount of information organized and accessible.

#### **Network**

The network is the Internet's circulatory system, consisting of the physical and virtual connections that enable data to flow from one point to another. This includes the cables, satellites, routers, and protocols that transport information across the globe, ensuring that an email or a video call can reach its destination in milliseconds.

#### **Applications**

At the top of the Internet stack are applications — the user-facing software that provides the services and experiences we interact with daily. Applications range from web browsers and social media to more complex systems like blockchain platforms and decentralized apps (dApps). They are the interface through which users interact with the digital world.

### **Blockchain's Place in the Application Layer**

Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized and secure nature, resides within the application layer of the Internet. It offers a revolutionary approach to conducting transactions, managing data, and establishing trust online, offering a level of security, transparency, and efficiency previously unattainable with traditional centralized systems. As a part of the application layer, blockchain applications leverage the underlying compute, storage, and network infrastructure to operate efficiently and securely. The full blockchain landscape can run on top of ThreeFold’s Internet stack. 

### **ThreeFold Today: Focusing on Compute and Storage**

At ThreeFold, we're committed to enhancing the foundational layers of the Internet, with a particular focus to date on compute and storage. Our journey has been driven by the belief that decentralizing these components can lead to a more secure, efficient, and equitable digital world. By distributing compute power and storage capacity across a global network, we aim to reduce reliance on centralized data centers, mitigate privacy and security risks, and lower the environmental impact of digital infrastructure.

### **The Road Ahead: Expanding to Connectivity**

Looking to the future, ThreeFold plans to integrate advanced connectivity solutions into our ecosystem. Recognizing the importance of robust network infrastructure, we're dedicated to improving bandwidth and reducing latency to ensure seamless access to digital services for everyone, everywhere. This expansion is not only about enhancing Internet performance but also about empowering blockchain applications and other innovations that depend on strong connectivity to thrive.
