### It all Started with a Vision About a Decade ago

When we saw how the Internet's existing infrastructure was becoming increasingly centralized, controlled by a handful of tech giants, and posed a threat to privacy and sovereignty, we knew it was time for a change. That's why we founded ThreeFold.

### Green Infrastructure

There is no Planet B. And the Internet is consumed a surprisingly large amount of the world's energy, between 5 and 10%. This is why ThreeFold has designed with efficiency in mind to create the most sustainable Internet infrastructure in the world.
