### **Our vision is a better digital world**

We believe in an Internet where everyone can communicate freely, exchange fairly, access educational information, and own their own data. Our digital experiences should not addict nor manipulate, rather empower.

### **Planet-First**

Our solutions must be sustainable. There is no Planet B.

<br>

And the Internet is consumed a surprisingly large amount of the world’s energy, ±10%. This is why ThreeFold has designed with efficiency in mind to create the most sustainable Internet infrastructure in the world. We must respect our mother earth.

### **People-First**

We empower self-sovereignty and autonomy.

Equality, diversity, and inclusion are key to our vision of an Internet for everyone, everywhere. ThreeFold has created a participatory infrastructure and movement, and is prioritizing efforts to bring a more accessible Internet to developing regions around the world.
