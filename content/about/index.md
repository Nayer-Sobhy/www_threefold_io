# Genesis

### It all Started with a Vision About a Decade ago

When we realized that the Internet's current infrastructure was becoming increasingly centralized, controlled by a handful of tech giants, and posing a threat to personal privacy, we knew it was time for a change. That's why we founded ThreeFold – to build the Internet the world deserves.

## **Our Mission**

### Enabling a decentralized Internet that empowers 
### individuals and communities  with economic and social freedom.
<br>
<p>
As we journey through the Information Age, humanity stands at the cusp of a remarkable transformation. <br>
The 15th-century invention of the printing press marked the dawn of knowledge transfer, <br> while the development of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 unlocked the world's information. <br>As society and technology progress, software's influence on our future grows.
</p>
<br>
<p>
In today's interconnected world, software drives an unprecedented wave of value creation.<br> A common misconception about software companies is that their worth lies in code, algorithms, or infrastructure. <br>However, the most significant value stems from the information and networks that we, the people, create.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Our collective efforts in generating articles, posts, or tweets contribute to a system far more valuable than the sum of its parts.<br> This collaboration powers search engines, maps, recommendations, and social networks, <br>allowing today's most influential software companies to command immense power and value.

Navigating the digital age, we're reminded of the power in collective action and the strength of the networks we create.<br> Our connections, ideas, and shared experiences lay the foundation for a new world built on freedom, sustainability, co-creation, and trust.<br> No longer confined by centralized entities, we possess the tools to build a brighter future together.

<br>

Our vision is a community-owned Internet that serves as a gateway to a world <br>where privacy, autonomy, and collaboration flourish. In this world, we protect our thoughts, messages, and memories <br>while retaining control over our digital lives and assets.

<br>

By embracing a decentralized infrastructure that supports emerging technologies, <br>we ensure that sovereignty, privacy, autonomy, and sustainability are integrated into every innovation.<br> We continue to cultivate a future that aligns with our shared principles and serves the greater good.

## **Imagine**

<br>

A world tailored to your needs, where your digital identity is protected, your voice is heard, and your creativity thrives. <br>In this world, we harness technology to shape a brighter, more equitable future for all. <br>Creators and builders of every kind are welcomed to join us in building ThreeFold together, not as employees but as co-owners. 

<br>

By recognizing the impact of today's technologies, we understand their role in shaping society. <br>Through collective effort, we develop software that empowers individuals to self-organize, <br>safeguard privacy and freedom of speech, and retain ownership of their creations without intermediaries. <br>This fosters independence and sovereignty, allowing people to choose their communities and forms of governance.

<br>

Together, we strive to dismantle monopolies of trust that have long defined our societies, <br>just as the printing press revolutionized the church's monopoly on truth,<br> paving the way for a world fostering freedom, trust, cooperation, and sustainability.<br>

<br>

The future is ours to build, and we're building it together. <br> Join us in creating a world reflecting shared values and aspirations, shaping a future that belongs to us all.
