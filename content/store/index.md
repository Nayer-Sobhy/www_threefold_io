## A fortress for your digital assets

Quantum Safe Storage is designed to intelligently encrypt, compress,  split data into multiple parts and distribute it across ThreeFoldâ€™s decentralized network. This unique approach ensures that even if an attacker were to access one node, they would only find non-relevant information. The only way to reconstruct your data is via your private key.
