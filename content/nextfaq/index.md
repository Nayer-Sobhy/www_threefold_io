## ThreeFold Goes Commercial | **FAQs**

ThreeFold's next phase is about commercialization and utilization. Some changes are coming which we believe are in the benefit of the project and all of us. Got questions? We've got answers.

#### Is the grid reliable? How will I be able to ensure my workloads are safe?

From a pure tech perspective, redundancy can be achieved by means of the quantum safe storage system, replication, Web Gateways, and more. However, this is too difficult for the starting user and we will need more tooling around it. Beyond that, in Grid 4.x, TF Cloud will provide support, Service Level Agreements, and easy credit card payments to provide a safe, smooth, and reliable experience. Farming pools will help as well, providing visibility into who is who and clarifying reputation regarding who reached which levels of service, uptime, and so on.

<br>

#### So now there will be two grids? Why?

One infrastructure, two grid versions. Now is the time for the project to go commercial and in order to present a reliable offering, TF Grid 4.x is necessary and will need to be the primary focus of the ThreeFold DMCC team. TF Grid 3.x will live on as a community-owned and operated entity, the perfect place for open source builders, Web3 enthusiasts, and testing.

<br>

#### What is a cooperative and why are we moving in that direction?

A [cooperative](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/what-is-a-cooperative) is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise. In the next phase of ThreeFold it is crucial we have governance done well and in a way which is widely accepted. Cooperatives present a well-proven governance structure.

<br>

#### Can you explain more about farming pools?

Farming pools allow farmers to group together and adhere to minimum service level agreements in order to provide reliability and trustworthiness for people using the capacity. Every 4.0 Farmer will be required to join a farming pool. Farming pools will have the opportunity to set the pricing for services they provide, and the option to stake on their farms. The pools will also prvide a regulated and centralized approach to staking, holding, selling, and buying of TFT. All in all, this creates a more simple and trustworthy experience for customers.

<br>

#### What will marketing look like in the new system?

Marketing and promotion will be done by different participants: the new ThreeFold Cooperative, TF Cloud, OurWorld promoted ventures, and more. Each of them will have their own teams, purpose, mission, vision, and funding sources. Therefore it will be more of a collaborative ecosystem approach rather than one entity responsible for all.

<br>

#### Will there be a strategy for node vendors?

In Grid 3.x, things remain the same. In 4.x, there is the new concept of farming pools. Node vendors can create their own farming pool or work with another one to define the rewards. For example, if a node vendor is also giving support and the farming pool is doing the publicity, the vendors and node hosters can split the revenue at their own discretion.

<br>

#### What do we expect for the TFT?

TFT remains a crucial component of our project. We are not here to speculate but there are some considerations and we have our own beliefs:

<br>

Previously the limit for total tokens in the ecosystem was 4 billion. To date, +-900 million tokens have been minted. With rules of farming becoming more strict in Grid 3.x and the halting of minting from Grid 4.x, we anticipate a positive impact on the market value of TFT, aligning with our commitment to sustainable and value-driven growth.

<br>

Please note that TFT should not be seen as an investment instrument.

<br>

#### What happens for the validators?

There are three intriguing ways for people to use their acquired tokens:

<br>

1. Staking on the validators in 3.x. For the moment, we have to find the nine initial guardians. As a note, the ward went from 5% to 25% on revenue.
2. Staking in Farming Pools in 4.x. Discount levels and other rewards to be determined.
3. Staking on 3Nodes in 4.x. This is needed for reputation with slashing potential.

<br>

Note: There has been a change in architecture since the validator program was concieved. We will go all in for peer-to-peer and a regulated approach.

<br>
