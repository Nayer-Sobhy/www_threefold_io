Oscar is working in IT for 30 years, being active international for almost half the time. He has a Master in IT and professionally certified in several IT architecture directions, together with his sales experience, he combined a couple of interesting skills to add value. He worked for corporates for 10 years after which he started his own company, driving his own beliefs. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold ThreeFold to me, is a new-age organization (driven from love and believe instead of ego), combining a couple of true new technologies. With this global movement, it is time to start a new economy. An economy based on other values, where responsibility and going Green are key words.
