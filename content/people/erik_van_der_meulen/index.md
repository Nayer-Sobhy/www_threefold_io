Erik firmly believes that entrepreneurship provides the only sustainable solution to many of humanity's greatest challenges. He has been active as an entrepreneur for over 25 years and co-founded several succesful businesses. Some of these are united in Powered By Meaning, a growing ecosystem of companies that have one shared mission which is to make impact through collective entrepreneurship. Erik is passionate about conceiving and realising new creative business concepts that unite both social and economic value. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold The Treefold Foundation aims to solve some of the fundamental shortcomings of the technologies that shape our future. I strongly support the values and the goals of the team and am exited about the opportunity to support them as ambassador.
