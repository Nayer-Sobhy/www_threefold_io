Former derivatives trader now involved as an owner or active investor in various businesses including private jet charter, luxury villa development in Thailand, green energy and renewables (global), a crypto derivatives exchange and private equity. I'm a British citizen but been living in HK since 2011 and spent 11 years living in Tokyo before that. Along with my partner we have set up Dragon Edge Cloud in HK, and are aiming to be a ThreeFold Farmer across the APAC region. Ambassador fell in love with Threefold People can't use it if they don't know about it, so it's vital that we spread the word about ThreeFold and raise awareness in the private and business communities. Even though I don't have a technology background, and have much to learn, being the only farmer this far east I feel compelled to step up and try to assist as much as I can. On the plus side, I have a wide network across the region, and should be able to open the right doors to allow us in over here.
