40 year infrastructure technology marketing veteran.  Participated in the UNIX, database, client-server, WWW and mobility stack wars.  My goal is to help people understand how technology can help them achieve goals.  I want everything I touch to be simple concrete and true.  I believe that humans can only flourish if they accept each other and seek out ways to increase understanding and collaboration.
