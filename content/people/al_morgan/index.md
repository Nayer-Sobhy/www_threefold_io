## Why ThreeFold?

Threefold helps people apply technology to achieve their goals while protecting their privacy. Distributing compute resource broadly reduces the risks that always accrue from concentration of data where it can become an attractive target for criminals or unethical government.

40 year infrastructure technology marketing veteran.  Participated in the UNIX, database, client-server, WWW and mobility stack wars.  My goal is to help people understand how technology can help them achieve goals.  I want everything I touch to be simple concrete and true.  I believe that humans can only flourish if they accept each other and seek out ways to increase understanding and collaboration.
