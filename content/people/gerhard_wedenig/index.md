## Why ThreeFold?

I believe that the access to and use of information and possibilities is a right to all humans
After an education in electrical engineering, I got drawn into IT, then called Data Processing. I wrote my first COBOL programm 1969. I stayed in this industry till I retired. I belive that even with an technical background, sales is very important. If you find no customer for your ideas, products or solutions they won't sustain. A good  amount of curiosity is a good base to remain active and vigilant. My aspiration is to maintain my level of development skills and knowledge and remain in the IT industry.
