My purpose is to build a society I would be honored to raise my children in. I envision a more-free, abundant, beautiful, paradise-society and am in service to the concepts, projects and visions that are demanding to be realized. I believe SEEDS is an integral aspect of our future societies that will transition our present culture into a world where people are supported in pursuing their passions and purpose. A world where local, healing-food is abundant and affordable. A world of interconnected collectives and economies that are owned by the people that comprise them. A world where the benefits and our global abundance is more equitably distributed for humanity and all life on our planet to flourish and thrive. I am involved in designing the protocols that comprise SEEDS, Hypha, Hypha DAO (The Peoples DAO), Light Food, Our NeighbourGood and The Heart Collaborative. I help organize and facilitate the progression of SEEDS and hold the space for our story to progress.
