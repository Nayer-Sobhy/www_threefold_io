Richard is an experienced senior leader offering a global perspective, having lived and worked in Europe, North America and Asia. A passionate, collaborative and decisive leader, he’s demonstrated the ability to drive change and build, motivate and lead teams to achieve outstanding business results in both developed and high growth emerging markets. He was most recently CEO of electric motorcycle start-up, Zero Motorcycles in California and had an extensive career at Hewlett Packard including running the consumer desktop PC business, a $6B piece of the overall PC business. He currently lives and works in Silicon Valley where he provides executive advisory services to a number of start-up companies. He is also a guest lecturer at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University and for the MBA program at USF in San Francisco, focusing his work on international marketing and the humanity of business. ThreeFold is setting out to transform computing as we know it today, in the most economic, socially positive and sustainable manner. Their innovative use of blockchain technology combined with an asset back token will ensure that a neutral, secure internet is available to all. I’m impressed with their mission/vision and I’m delighted to be a ThreeFold Ambassador.
