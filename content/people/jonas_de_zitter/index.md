Hi. My name is Jonas De Zitter, living in East Flanders Belgium. I have always been fascinated by all kinds of technology.. After my engineering studies, I started working at a development company in Ghent where I make custom electronics and provide consultancy. Since 2016 I have become involved in crypto, after which I founded CryptoConnect together with Gert De Spiegeleer. From that company I started developing green battery systems and I assist Gert with his fast-growing start-up Ethernetics.

### Why ThreeFold?

Threefold cought my attention many years ago as a high potential decentralised network solution. From the moment I started following , more and more parts of the puzzle came together, resulting in a new type of internet with features we could't even imagine. It has a great community and combines knowledge and experience from all over the world.
