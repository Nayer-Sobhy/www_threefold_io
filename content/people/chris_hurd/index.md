Having graduated from the University of Cambridge, I spent most of my career to date in wholesale banking with the HSBC Group. This gave me priceless experience and geographic exposure with my last 3 jobs being at MD level in London, Singapore and Moscow respectively. My responsibilities for managing and leading teams of people in the customer front line helped to fine tune my values which centre around doing the right thing by people and for myself. Since moving on from banking I have been fortunate in being able to acquire new skills and to reinvent, but always with the same values as an underpin. Time is very precious and should be well spent with a sense of humour an absolute essential.

### Why ThreeFold?

I was delighted to join Threefold as an Ambassador as it is an environment which resonates well with who I am . Its appeal for me lies in its potential for massive social benefit combined with investment opportunity.
