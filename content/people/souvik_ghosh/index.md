I have been working in Finance industry, mainly in IT sector as an engineer, architect and more recently as AI/ML engineer. I am passionate about technology and along with my day-job, I am also working as a freelance ML specialist. The technology behind threefold is convincing and the mission to build more user-centric internet. Most importantly, I am originally from India and I understand fully why access to free internet is a fundamental human right and what information warfare can do to a country. ThreeFold is on a mission to make it right and it would be an honour to be part of such a mission. My contributions will be mostly technical coming from a world of analytics and working on Natural Language Processing for past 2 years dedicated a good amount of my time building open-source products. My contribution for the moment is focussed around 3bot.
