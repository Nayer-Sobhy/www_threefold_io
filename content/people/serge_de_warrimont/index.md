I believe that hard work, communication of ideas, and inspiration is the key to success in the world of industrial design and I get a great sense of fulfilment when something Iâ€™ve put my heart and soul into influences someone in some way. I am creatively driven and passionate about current design. To me, the best products are those that grow and change with use; products that wear in, not wear out. I am inspired by products that approach sustainability by being long lasting and important in life.
