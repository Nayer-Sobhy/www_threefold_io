Ambassador fell in love with Threefold The internet has turned into a centralized mainframe like phenomena dominated by a few global giants and ThreeFold Foundation’s grid-like distributed & eco-friendly internet is taking it back to its roots providing an alternative. Using this infrastructure to back-up the new Coin Offering brings also a solid alternative to the speculative virtual currencies making it also more tangible.
