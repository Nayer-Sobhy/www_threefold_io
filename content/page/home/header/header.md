ThreeFold’s peer-to-peer nature brings considerable energy efficiencies as compared to current solutions. 
<br/>
<br/>
The remaining carbon footprint of the grid will be converted into carbon credits and invested in planet positive projects to enable the world’s first carbon neutral grid.

<!-- With our game-changing technology and incredible partners, together we are building a better Internet – for humanity and for our planet. 
<br/>
<br/>
The ThreeFold peer-to-peer (P2P) Internet delivers on privacy and security, gives us all back ownership of our digital lives, can be made available everywhere in the world, and uses much less energy than today's solution. 
<br/>
<br/>
It is the foundation for a more fair and equal tomorrow. 
<br/>
And it is available, today! -->

<!-- We are building the next generation peer-to-peer internet infrastructure. After creating a powerful and super sustainable operating system that can host all of humanity's digital needs and data in smart contracts, we are now creating a fair, equal and private Internet experience to free humanity from the tech giants that exploit our data.
