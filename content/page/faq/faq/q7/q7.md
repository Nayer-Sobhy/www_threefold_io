question: How can I get involved with ThreeFold if I'm not very technical?
---

There are many ways for anyone to participate in the ThreeFold movement:
- Become a [Farmer](https://farming.threefold.io/farm) and connect sovereign and planet positive Internet capacity from your home or office. 
- Buy [ThreeFold Tokens](https://threefold.io/info/threefold#/threefold__how_to_buy_and_sell) to grow the new Internet economy and use it to reserve private and secure Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. 
- Join a collaborative ecosystem of partners that choose to take action, and together build the most efficient and secure technological infrastructures, equalitarian and sovereign applications and regenerate our planet. Join us - [the ThreeFold ecosystem](https://t.me/threefold) or [the Alliance for a Conscious Internet](https://threefold.io/aci).
- Become a ThreeFold Advocate by sharing about us within your networks. Wether one or thousands of people, with the butterfly effect, everyone counts!
- Join our [community](https://t.me/threefold), [forum](https://forum.threefold.io/) and [github](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation) to support us in our growth by participating in our conversations and development.
- And more.. we are very open to new ideas.
