question: How ThreeFold compares toÂ similar projects in the decentralization space?
---

We've been asked how we differentiate from Dfinity, Solid, Akash and Holochain amongst other projects so some of the ThreeFold team members opened threads on our forum to start conversations around it and be able to answer our community's questions in regards to these comparisons. Feel free to join the conversation:
