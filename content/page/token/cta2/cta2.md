TFT is valuable in different ways for different people.

For TFT holders, TFT is valuable because it is worth actual sovereign capacity. 

Today, TFT is becoming more valuable to people and organizations as they can deploy their solutions and applications on ThreeFold with full data sovereignty and security. 

Many also believe that ThreeFold’s Internet architecture is the most advanced in the world and buy TFT to support the further developments of the ThreeFold technology stack.

Of course, there are those whomany also see it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. But TFT shouldn’t be seen as an investment instrument or a way for short- term gains and speculation. The TFT isas it represents a way to participate in a planet positive and data sovereign Internet.
