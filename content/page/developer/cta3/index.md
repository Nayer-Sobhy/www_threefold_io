ThreeFold is here to build the open-source Internet and Cloud infrastructure. 
The documentation helps you build on ThreeFold by introducing you to some foundational concepts as well as our  development stacks.

Inspired by the open-source movement, everything at ThreeFold is open to be audited, extended and improved. If you have any feedback, please reach out with a GitHub issue or on our [telegram.](https://t.me/threefoldnews)
