# Developer tooling

ThreeFold's Internet and cloud infrastructure is designed to power the transition from the web2 to the web3 era seamlessly.
TerraForm's infrastructure as code, Kubernetes and Docker are 100% supported by ThreeFold's decentralized cloud computing environment.  Also threeFold built the first quantum safe Internet storage system in the world, a sustainable, souvereign, private and secure alternative to centralised clouds.
