question: How can I get my tokens back if I lost my seed key?

Your seed key is the only way to retrieve or migrate your funds from damaged or deleted wallet. You should always make sure to have a backup of your seed key stored in a safe place. In case of unfortunate loss, no one will be able to assist you.
