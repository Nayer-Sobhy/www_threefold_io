Our digital world is far too CENTRALISED. Centralized hyperscale data centers are the backbone of the internet today yet 80% of the internet capacity is owned by less than 20 companies. These hyperscale data centers are not secure, unscalable and are very power-hungry. The approach of adding more people, technology layers, and hence complexity is flawed. For the sake of both humanity and our planet, things need to change.

<br/>

If we are to meet the demand for decentralization in the data economy, 2 key things must change.
1. Decentralisation of the compute and storage infrastructure that serves as the substrate to the economy itself, and
2. Our rights to ownership and privacy of our information (data) must be enforced. These are Non-Negotiable!!

<br/>

ThreeFold promises a true peer-to-peer internet, empowering equality, autonomy, and sustainability with game-changing technology built with a collaborative ecosystem. The ThreeFold Grid is live and already distributed across 21+ countries and expanding daily.
