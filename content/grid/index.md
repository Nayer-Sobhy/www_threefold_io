## Internet **Re-Imagined.** Internet **Re-Built.**

<br>

Over a decade ago, a group of early Internet pioneers, who understood the problems of the centralized Internet first-hand, came together to re-imagine the infrastructure for an open and decentralized Internet. But we didn’t just imagine it – we built it.

## ThreeFold **Benefits**

<br/>

### **Edge Capacity**

Achieve low latencies and bandwidth efficiency by reserving capacity locally.

|||

![Image](secure_.png#medium)

<br/>

### **Secure**

Open-source system built from the ground-up for a fully transparent and auditable stack.

|||

![Image](scalable_.png#medium)

<br/>

### **Scalable**

An autonomous infrastructure that grows naturally with demand, where and when it is needed.

|||

![Image](efficient_.png#medium)

<br/>

### **Efficient**

A carefully designed collection of lightweight components that minimize overheads.

## The Layer-0 for **Decentralization**

Any current or future technology, including blockchain, metaverses and web 3.0, can be hosted natively on the ThreeFold Grid via smart contracts with minimum migration. The grid is compatible with most open source tools and protocols.

## ThreeFold is **Different**

<br>

### **Beyond a Protocol**

The ThreeFold Grid is not just another protocol, it's a community-owned and managed low level decentralized Internet capacity layer and infrastructure, on top of which any protocol can run.

### **Complementing Web3**

ThreeFold is not a Web3 project, but we believe in the potential of Web3 – and the ThreeFold Grid can host and complement any Web3 project, finally providing a truly decentralized backbone for the space.

<br>

### **Highly-Compatible**

The stack was built around open-source and simplicity, and to be compatibile with current and future IT standards such as Kubernetes, Docker, IPFS and S3. If it runs on Linux, it can be hosted on ThreeFold.

<!-- It is an alternative to the centralized Internet model – a decentralized infrastructure for the builders of tomorrow.** -->

## Scaled by the People <br> **to the Edge**

The ThreeFold Grid is formed by Farmers, independent people who connect 3Nodes (decentralized Internet capacity) anywhere electricity and network are present. Together, they form a globally distributed Internet infrastructure and earn income in the form of TFT.

## A New **Internet Blueprint**

All our code is made open source to energize open collaboration and promote universal access to a peer-to-peer Internet owned by all of us. More than just an Internet infrastructure, the ThreeFold Grid holds the potential to decentralize everything.

## A Revolutionary <br> **Operating System**

A decentralized autonomous operating system designed to dedicate hardware capacity to ThreeFold. Zero-OS can be booted on most modern computers to host anything that runs on Linux in a decentralized way.
