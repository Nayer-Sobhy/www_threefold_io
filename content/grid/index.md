## Internet **Re-Imagined.** Internet **Re-Built.**

<br>

Over a decade ago, a group of early Internet pioneers, who understood the problems of the centralized Internet model first-hand, came together to re-imagine the infrastructure for an open and decentralized Internet. But we didn’t just imagine it – we built it.

## The Layer-0 for **Decentralization**

Any current or future technology, including blockchain, metaverses and web 3.0, can be hosted natively on the ThreeFold Grid via smart contracts with minimum migration. The grid is compatible with most open source tools and protocols.

## Scaled by the People <br> **to the Edge**

The ThreeFold Grid is formed by Farmers, independent people who connect 3Nodes (decentralized Internet capacity) anywhere electricity and network are present. Together, they form a globally distributed Internet infrastructure and earn income in the form of TFT.

## A New **Internet Blueprint**

All our code is made open source to energize open collaboration and promote universal access to a peer-to-peer Internet owned by all of us. More than just an Internet infrastructure, the ThreeFold Grid holds the potential to decentralize everything.

## A Revolutionary <br> **Operating System**

A decentralized autonomous operating system designed to dedicate hardware capacity to the People’s Internet via the ThreeFold Blockchain. Zero-OS can be booted on most modern computers to host anything that runs on Linux in a decentralized way.

## A Decentralized **Internet Economy**

TFT is the official medium of exchange for Internet capacity on the ThreeFold Grid. The utility token allows users to reserve Internet capacity via the ThreeFold Blockchain and rewards farmers for their contribution to the network.

## The **Missing Layer**

While many projects have created bits and pieces of what a decentralized Internet would look like, ThreeFold is decentralizing the entire Internet model. The blockchain world is missing this decentralized foundational layer. ThreeFold provides the peer-to-peer Internet infrastructure to interconnect the entire blockchain and web3 space.
