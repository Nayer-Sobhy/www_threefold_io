As part of the grid, ThreeFold is also implementing a planetary network. To date, we were using yggdrasil as the core technology for this network. However, the team noticed some limitations and ultimately decided to work on our own Ipv6 overlay network to accomplish our specific needs.

Take a look at this [interesting write-up](https://forum.threefold.io/t/introducing-mycelium/4082) by Lee who is also leading the efforts on this super exciting initiative. We'll share more developments and a demo when ready. Thanks Lee!
