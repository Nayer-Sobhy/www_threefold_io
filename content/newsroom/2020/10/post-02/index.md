ThreeFold **Now Marketplace** is a peer-to-peer alternative to centralized cloud providers, enabling you to deploy independently and keep ownership of your own data. ðŸ™Œ

Starting this November you'll be able to choose and test the first tools available on Marketplace, such as discourse, gitea, website, and more.

**Stay tuned!**
