Good news! The implementation of the feature is now complete. [From the team](https://forum.threefold.io/t/tfgrid-power-management-feature-for-3-8-1/3721/14?u=gosam), “We are starting end-to-end tests today. Once those succeed the community is welcome to test it on their own (on devnet for now). If everything goes as planned you can expect it within days.”
