üß≥ **Grid V2 to Grid V3 Migration Update**

<br/>

**Together with Take Action Global ü§ù we are taking real action to make the ThreeFold Grid the first planet-positive üåç Internet infrastructure in the world.**

<br/>

Take a look at our three-part series to explore these efforts:

<br/>

- [Pt I: ThreeFold on track to be planet-positive](https://forum.threefold.io/t/threefold-on-track-to-be-planet-positive/2097/3)
- [Pt II: Supporting initiatives to regenerate the planet](https://forum.threefold.io/t/supporting-initiatives-to-regenerate-the-planet/2110)
- [Pt III: Driving regeneration with Take Action Global](https://forum.threefold.io/t/driving-regeneration-with-tag/2120)

<br/>

*You can support a planet-positive Internet by becoming a farmer! All you have to do is connect capacity to the grid and you‚Äôre effortlessly contributing to the regeneration of our planet, as this model will allow all farms to become planet positive by default.*
