Last week we announced our plan to make the ThreeFold Token more accessible through multichain integrations – with Binance Smart Chain up first!
<br />
<br />
**Today we are happy to update that the BSC integration is going just as planned and next week, TFT will be available there.**
<br />
<br />
**Please note that our next announcement will include the official contract address and the pair contract. If you don't see it from us, it's not authentic.**
<br />
<br />
We can’t wait for this integration to be live and to share the good news and details with you, our beautiful community. Thanks for your support!
