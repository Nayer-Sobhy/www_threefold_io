Today, we're excited to share with you **[a demo of the ultra-secure peer-to-peer file browser (storage) solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT_dKuvF6Ng)** that's being built on top of the ThreeFold Grid!
<br/>
<br/>
This is part of a series of demos showcasing a little piece of what we're building at the ThreeFold â€“ private, secure, peer-to-peer alternatives to many of the tools and experiences we all use today.
<br/>
<br/>

*Last week, we shared a demo of the self-hosted video solution, which you can find [here](https://threefold.io/news/post/video_chat_demo/).*

See you next time! ðŸ‘‹
