We wanted to update the community that Liquid, an exchange on which TFT is listed, [shared this morning](https://twitter.com/Liquid_Global/status/1428176357515612165?s=09) that warm wallets on the exchange were compromised in a hack.
<br/>
<br/>
**It appears that Stellar-based assets (e.g. TFT) were not stolen.**
