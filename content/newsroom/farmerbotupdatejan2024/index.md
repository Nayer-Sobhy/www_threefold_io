Dive into the [upgraded ThreeFold Grid Dashboard](https://forum.threefold.io/t/the-new-and-improved-tf-grid-dashboard-ui-ux/4202), designed for seamless TF Grid management and deployment. We've prioritized simplicity and intuition in the user experience. 

<br/>

Discover outstanding features such as access to node resource details via node ID when selecting a node for deployment, statistics on dedicated nodes and GPU-equipped nodes, and billing rates for the month conveniently located under the contract tabs.

Testing starts next week! *Thanks to those in the community who have provided feedback and helped us to get to this milestone.*
