Earlier this week, Weynand and Scott introduced the topic of building your own weblets! The session included a demo, and would be relevant for anybody looking to build and monetize on top of ThreeFold. Take a look at the recording and ask questions [here](https://forum.threefold.io/t/building-your-own-weblets-community-call-recording/3553).

<br/>

More to come on this exciting topic!
