Hi all â€“ we are pleased to share that we are in the final stages of testing Grid 2.4. We have found eVDC, 3Bot SDK, and Marketplace solution deployment & payment to be quite stable.
<br/>
<br/>
In the coming days we will have an exact date for mainnet launch and some more details for you to get started on our most exciting release to date!
