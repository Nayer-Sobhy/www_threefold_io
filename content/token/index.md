![](utility.png#icon)

### **Real Utility**
Users, developers, and enterprises use TFT to store data, build applications, and create P2P ecosystems on the ThreeFold Grid.

|||

![](fast.png#icon)

### **Super Fast**
Send TFT in milliseconds to anyone, anywhere – and as the network grows and hardware gets more efficient, so will the network..

|||

![](fundamentals.png#icon)

### **Strong Fundamentals**
With a limited supply of 4 billion TFT and a burning mechanism, the token is backed by the continuous growth of the network.

{% end %}

{% row(style="center between narrow mbottom") %}

![](cryptography.png#icon)

### **Secured by Cryptography**
TFT transactions and smart contracts on the ThreeFold Grid are secured by advanced cryptography.

|||

![](scalable.png#icon)

### **Ultra-Scalable**
ThreeFold is made to handle thousands of transactions and smart contracts per second, with incredibly low fees.

|||

![](efficient.png#icon)

### **Energy-efficient**
ThreeFold’s innovative infrastructure is incredibly sustainable, ensuring the tokens sustainability and longevity.

## Empowering a **New Internet Era**

ThreeFold uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no centralized servers or intermediaries, <br>providing a decentralized and open-source environment where everyone can participate. <br>

TFT serves as the medium of exchange on the ThreeFold Grid, empowering users to build and access services on top of a grid they co-own.
