## Farm

### A new way of growing the Internet

3Nodes provide Internet capacity for millions of people using ThreeFold’s Planetary Network, and you earn TFT for doing so. And because of a unique operating system, called Zero-OS, once turned on your 3Node runs by itself.

<br>

All you need to get started is a 3Node, electricity and a network connection.

<br>

The 3Node’s Internet capacity is automatically registered in the blockchain.

Every month, you earn TFT for keeping the 3Node connected to the network.

<!-- section 4 (How To Earn TFT) -->

{% row(style="center mtop narrow") %}


## How to earn **TFT**

Farmers earn TFT according to the amount of Internet capacity their 3Nodes connect to the ThreeFold Grid. The Internet capacity is verified by the ThreeFold Blockchain on an ongoing basis using the “Proof-of-Capacity” algorithm.

<br>

#### Proof of Capacity

### The Farming Process

{% end %}

{% row(style="center mbottom") %}

TFT is minted only when new Internet capacity is added to the ThreeFold Grid.

Farmers earn the TFT after meeting the minimum uptime as proof-of-capacity.

<!-- section 7 (THE VALUE OF TFT) -->

{% row(style="center between margin") %}


## The **Value of TFT**

The ThreeFold Grid is the only Internet infrastructure that can scale to the far edges of our world and meet the insatiable demands of emerging IT workloads. The more the ThreeFold Grid is used, the more TFT are “burnt” to reduce the total circulating supply..
